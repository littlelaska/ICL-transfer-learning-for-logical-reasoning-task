Joe finished below Mya.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is true?\nOptions:\nA) Eve finished last.\nB) Eli finished last.\nC) Joe finished last.\nD) Rob finished last.\nE) Mya finished last.\nReasoning:\nLet’s reason through the conditions step by step.  \n\n1. Eve finished first.  \n   Order so far: 1st: Eve, then 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th unknown.\n\n2. Rob finished above Mya.  \n   Rob > Mya in ranking (lower number = better finish).\n\n3. Joe finished above Eli.  \n   Joe > Eli.\n\n4. Joe finished below Mya.  \n   Mya > Joe.  \n   Combined with Joe > Eli: Mya > Joe > Eli.  \n   Combined with Rob > Mya: Rob > Mya > Joe > Eli.\n\n5. Now fit Eve (1st) into the partial order Rob > Mya > Joe > Eli.  \n   Rob cannot be 1st because Eve is 1st, so Rob must be 2nd or later, but Rob must be above Mya, Mya above Joe, Joe above Eli.  \n   Let’s test possible positions:  \n   • If Rob is 2nd, then Mya is after Rob (3rd, 4th, or 5th), but Mya must be above Joe, Joe above Eli.  \n\n     So possible: Rob (2nd), Mya (3rd), Joe (4th), Eli (5th).  \n   • Check: Eve (1st), Rob (2nd), Mya (3rd), Joe (4th), Eli (5th).  \n\n     All conditions satisfied:  \n     Rob > Mya ✓, Joe > Eli ✓, Joe below Mya ✓, Eve 1st ✓.  \n\n6. Who is last?  \n   In this arrangement, Eli is last.  \n\nSo the true statement: Eli finished last.  \n\nThe correct option is: B\nAnswer:\nB\n\n"}

The watermelons are the most expensive.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is true?\nOptions:\nA) The mangoes are the most expensive.\nB) The kiwis are the most expensive.\nC) The plums are the most expensive.\nD) The pears are the most expensive.\nE) The watermelons are the most expensive.\nReasoning:\nLet’s reason step by step.  \n\n1. Fruits: mangoes (M), kiwis (K), plums (P), pears (Pe), watermelons (W).  \n2. \"Kiwis are less expensive than plums\" → K < P (in price).  \n3. \"Pears are the third-most expensive\" → Pe is 3rd from most expensive (so 3rd highest price).  \n4. \"Kiwis are the second-cheapest\" → K is 2nd from cheapest (so 4th highest price, since 5 total).  \n5. \"Watermelons are the most expensive\" → W is 1st (most expensive).  \n\nOrder from most expensive (1) to cheapest (5):  \n\n• Position 1: W (given).  \n\n• Position 4: K (2nd-cheapest = 4th most expensive).  \n\n• K < P means P must be more expensive than K, so P must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  \n\n• But position 1 is W, so P is in position 2 or 3.  \n\n• Position 3 is Pe (given).  \n\nIf P were in position 3, then Pe would also be in position 3 — impossible (two different fruits can’t be in same position). So P must be in position 2.  \n\nThus:  \n1: W  \n2: P  \n3: Pe  \n4: K  \n5: M (only position left).  \n\nMost expensive is W.  \n\nThe correct option is: E\nAnswer:\nE\n\n"}

That leaves 1 position for Blue Jay and Hawk.  \n\n6. \"The blue jay is the third from the right\" → Blue Jay is in position 5 if positions counted from right: 7=1st from right, 6=2nd, 5=3rd from right. So Blue Jay = position 5.  \n\nBut if Blue Jay = 5, then Falcon cannot be 5 (Falcon ≠ Blue Jay). So Falcon ≠ 5.  \n\nLet’s try to place Blue Jay = 5.  \n\nFrom Owl (2) < Robin < Hummingbird < Falcon < Quail:  \nIf Blue Jay = 5, then 5 is taken, so Falcon must be after 5 → Falcon = 6 or 7.  \n\nIf Falcon = 6, then Quail = 7.  \nThen Robin < Hummingbird < Falcon means: Robin = 3 or 4, Hummingbird = 4 or (if Robin=3, Hummingbird=4), but Hummingbird < Falcon=6, so Hummingbird could be 4 or 5, but 5 is Blue Jay, so Hummingbird = 4.

Dan finished below Eli → Eli < Dan.  \n\nFrom 3 and 2: Eli < Dan < Ada < Mel.  \n\nSo order: Eli … Dan … Ada … Mel.  \n\nStep 3 – Filling in constraints  \nWe have positions 1, 2, 4, 6 open (since 3, 5, 7 are taken by Eve, Ana, Amy).  \n\nEli must be before Dan, Dan before Ada, Ada before Mel.  \nAlso Mel must be after Ada, so Mel could be 6th (since 5 is Ana, 7 is Amy).  \n\nCheck: If Mel is 6th → Ada must be before 6th, but after Dan. Possible Ada in 4th? Let’s test:  \n\nPositions: 1, 2, 4, 6 for Eli, Dan, Ada, Mel in that order.  \nSo: Eli = 1, Dan = 2, Ada = 4, Mel = 6.  \n\nThat fits:  \n1: Eli  \n2: Dan  \n3: Eve  \n4: Ada  \n5: Ana  \n6: Mel  \n7: Amy  \n\nCheck all conditions:  \n• Ada above Mel → 4 < 6 ✓  \n\n• Dan above Ada → 2 < 4 ✓  \n\n• Dan below Eli → 1 < 2?

The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.\n\nIn a golf tournament, there were five golfers: Rob, Amy, Eve, Mya, and Ana. Mya finished below Rob. Ana finished below Eve. Amy finished second. Eve finished below Mya.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is true?\nOptions:\nA) Rob finished second-to-last.\nB) Amy finished second-to-last.\nC) Eve finished second-to-last.\nD) Mya finished second-to-last.\nE) Ana finished second-to-last.\nReasoning:\nLet’s reason through the clues step by step.  \n\nWe have 5 golfers: Rob, Amy, Eve, Mya, Ana.  \nPositions: 1st (highest) to 5th (lowest).  \n\n1. Amy finished second → Amy is in position 2.  \n2. Mya finished below Rob → Rob finished above Mya.  \n3. Ana finished below Eve → Eve finished above Ana.  \n4. Eve finished below Mya → Mya finished above Eve.  \n\nFrom 2 and 4:  \nRob > Mya > Eve.  \n\nFrom 3: Eve > Ana.  \n\nSo: Rob > Mya > Eve > Ana.  \n\nAmy is fixed at position 2.  \n\nLet’s try to fit Rob, Mya, Eve, Ana around Amy’s position 2.  \n\nIf Amy is 2nd, then 1st must be someone else.  \n\nRob is above Mya, Eve, and Ana. Could Rob be 1st?  \nIf Rob is 1st:  \nThen Mya is below Rob, so Mya could be 3rd, 4th, or 5th. But Mya > Eve > Ana.  \nSo Mya can’t be 5th (because then Eve and Ana would be below her but there’d be no room for both below her if she’s last). Let’s check systematically:  \n\nWe have positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  \nPos 2 = Amy.  \n\nRob = pos 1.  \nMya must be below Rob but above Eve.  \nEve must be above Ana.  \n\nPossible arrangement:  \n1: Rob  \n2: Amy  \n3: Mya  \n4: Eve  \n5: Ana  \n\nCheck:  \nMya below Rob? Yes (3 vs 1).  \nAna below Eve? Yes (5 vs 4).  \nAmy second? Yes.  \nEve below Mya? Yes (4 vs 3).  \n\nAll consistent.  \n\nSecond-to-last means 4th place.  \n4th place = Eve.  \n\nSo Eve finished second-to-last.  \n\nThe correct option is: C\nAnswer:\nC\n\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.

(Eli’s position number > Amy’s position number)  \n\n• Amy finished below Rob. (Amy’s position number > Rob’s position number, so Amy is not 1st; Rob is 2nd, so Amy is 3rd or lower, but 3rd is Ada, 4th is Ana, so Amy must be 5th or 6th.)  \n\nLet’s test Amy’s position:  \nIf Amy is 5th, then Eli must be 6th (since Eli below Amy → Eli’s position > 5, and only 6 and 7 left, but 7 is Dan, so Eli must be 6th).  \nThen the remaining 1st position goes to Joe.  \n\nCheck:  \n1: Joe  \n2: Rob  \n3: Ada  \n4: Ana  \n5: Amy  \n6: Eli  \n7: Dan  \n\nAll conditions satisfied:  \n• Eli (6) below Amy (5) ✓  \n\n• Amy (5) below Rob (2) ✓  \n\n• Dan last ✓  \n\nSo Dan is definitely last.  \n\nFrom the options:  \nE) Dan finished last.  \n\nThe correct option is: E\nAnswer:\nE\n\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.

There are 7 golfers: Joe, Eli, Ada, Mel, Eve, Rob, Ana.  \n2. Joe finished first → Position 1: Joe.  \n3. Mel finished second-to-last → Position 6: Mel.  \n4. Rob finished above Eve → Rob < Eve in position numbers (smaller position number = better finish).  \n5. Mel finished above Eli → Mel < Eli → Mel (6) above Eli? Wait, that’s impossible if positions are 1–7, because 6 is worse than 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  \n   • \"Above\" means better position → smaller number.  \n\n   • So Mel (6) above Eli → Eli must be worse than 6 → Eli must be 7.  \n\n   Yes! That’s the key: If Mel is 6th, and Mel finished above Eli, then Eli must be 7th.  \n\n6. Rob finished below Ada → Ada < Rob (smaller position number for Ada).  \n7. Eve finished 4th → Position 4: Eve.  \n\nFrom 5: Eli is 7th.  \n\nFrom 4: Rob above Eve → Rob’s position < 4. So Rob is in {1, 2, 3}.

Rob finished above Eve → Rob < Eve in position number (smaller number = better).  \n4. Mel finished above Eli → Mel (6th) above Eli means Eli must be 7th (since only 7th is below 6th).  \n5. Rob finished below Ada → Ada < Rob in position number.  \n6. Eve finished fourth → Eve is 4th.  \n\nFrom (3) Rob above Eve → Rob’s position < 4 → Rob is 1, 2, or 3.  \nBut Joe is 1, so Rob is 2 or 3.  \n\nFrom (5) Ada < Rob → Ada is better than Rob → Ada must be 1 or 2 if Rob is 2 or 3.  \nBut Joe is 1, so Ada cannot be 1.  \n\nSo:  \n• If Rob is 2 → Ada must be 1 (impossible, Joe is 1) → contradiction.  \n\n• If Rob is 3 → Ada must be 1 or 2.

Eve finished first.  \n   Order so far: 1st: Eve, then 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th unknown.\n\n2. Rob finished above Mya.  \n   Rob > Mya in ranking (lower number = better finish).\n\n3. Joe finished above Eli.  \n   Joe > Eli.\n\n4. Joe finished below Mya.  \n   Mya > Joe.  \n   Combined with Joe > Eli: Mya > Joe > Eli.  \n   Combined with Rob > Mya: Rob > Mya > Joe > Eli.\n\n5. Now fit Eve (1st) into the partial order Rob > Mya > Joe > Eli.  \n   Rob cannot be 1st because Eve is 1st, so Rob must be 2nd or later, but Rob must be above Mya, Mya above Joe, Joe above Eli.  \n   Let’s test possible positions:  \n   • If Rob is 2nd, then Mya is after Rob (3rd, 4th, or 5th), but Mya must be above Joe, Joe above Eli.  \n\n     So possible: Rob (2nd), Mya (3rd), Joe (4th), Eli (5th).  \n   • Check: Eve (1st), Rob (2nd), Mya (3rd), Joe (4th), Eli (5th).  \n\n     All conditions satisfied:  \n     Rob > Mya ✓, Joe > Eli ✓, Joe below Mya ✓, Eve 1st ✓.  \n\n6. Who is last?  \n   In this arrangement, Eli is last.  \n\nSo the true statement: Eli finished last.  \n\nThe correct option is: B\nAnswer:\nB\n\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.\n\nIn a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Joe, Dan, Ana, Mel, Ada, Eve, and Amy. Eve finished above Amy. Dan finished second. Ada finished below Ana. Ana finished third-to-last. Mel finished last. Amy finished third.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is true?\nOptions:\nA) Joe finished second.\nB) Dan finished second.\nC) Ana finished second.\nD) Mel finished second.\nE) Ada finished second.\nF) Eve finished second.\nG) Amy finished second.\nReasoning:\nLet’s break this down step by step.  \n\nStep 1 – Known fixed positions  \n• Dan finished second. (Given explicitly.)  \n\n• Amy finished third. (Given.)  \n\n• Mel finished last (7th).  \n\n• Ana finished third-to-last (i.e., 5th place out of 7).  \n\nSo far:  \n1: ?  \n2: Dan  \n3: Amy  \n4: ?  \n5: Ana  \n6: ?  \n7: Mel  \n\nStep 2 – Other constraints  \n• Eve finished above Amy → Eve must be in position 1 or 2, but 2 is Dan, so Eve must be 1st.  \n\nNow:  \n1: Eve  \n2: Dan  \n3: Amy  \n4: ?  \n5: Ana  \n6: ?  \n7: Mel  \n\n• Ada finished below Ana → Ana is 5th, so Ada must be 6th (since 7th is Mel).  \n\nNow:  \n1: Eve  \n2: Dan  \n3: Amy  \n4: Joe (only one left for this spot)  \n5: Ana  \n6: Ada  \n7: Mel  \n\nStep 3 – Check the options  \nOption B says: Dan finished second. This matches our table.  \n\nStep 4 – Verify no contradictions  \nAll conditions satisfied:  \n• Eve above Amy ✓ (1 vs 3)  \n\n• Dan 2nd ✓  \n\n• Ada below Ana ✓ (6 vs 5)  \n\n• Ana 5th (third-to-last) ✓  \n\n• Mel last ✓  \n\n• Amy 3rd ✓  \n\nStep 5 – Conclusion  \nThe correct option is B.  \n\nThe correct option is: B\nAnswer:\nB\n\n"}

The watermelons are the most expensive.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is true?\nOptions:\nA) The mangoes are the most expensive.\nB) The kiwis are the most expensive.\nC) The plums are the most expensive.\nD) The pears are the most expensive.\nE) The watermelons are the most expensive.\nReasoning:\nLet’s reason step by step.  \n\n1. Fruits: mangoes (M), kiwis (K), plums (P), pears (Pe), watermelons (W).  \n2. \"Kiwis are less expensive than plums\" → K < P (in price).  \n3. \"Pears are the third-most expensive\" → Pe is 3rd from most expensive (so 3rd highest price).  \n4. \"Kiwis are the second-cheapest\" → K is 2nd from cheapest (so 4th highest price, since 5 total).  \n5. \"Watermelons are the most expensive\" → W is 1st (most expensive).  \n\nOrder from most expensive (1) to cheapest (5):  \n\n• Position 1: W (given).  \n\n• Position 4: K (2nd-cheapest = 4th most expensive).  \n\n• K < P means P must be more expensive than K, so P must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  \n\n• But position 1 is W, so P is in position 2 or 3.  \n\n• Position 3 is Pe (given).  \n\nIf P were in position 3, then Pe would also be in position 3 — impossible (two different fruits can’t be in same position). So P must be in position 2.  \n\nThus:  \n1: W  \n2: P  \n3: Pe  \n4: K  \n5: M (only position left).  \n\nMost expensive is W.  \n\nThe correct option is: E\nAnswer:\nE\n\n"}

Mel finished second-to-last. Rob finished above Eve. Mel finished above Eli. Rob finished below Ada. Eve finished fourth.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is true?\nOptions:\nA) Joe finished last.\nB) Eli finished last.\nC) Ada finished last.\nD) Mel finished last.\nE) Eve finished last.\nF) Rob finished last.\nG) Ana finished last.\nReasoning:\nLet’s break it down step by step.  \n\nKnown facts:  \n1. There are 7 golfers: Joe, Eli, Ada, Mel, Eve, Rob, Ana.  \n2. Joe finished first → Position 1: Joe.  \n3. Mel finished second-to-last → Position 6: Mel.  \n4. Rob finished above Eve → Rob < Eve in position numbers (smaller position number = better finish).  \n5. Mel finished above Eli → Mel < Eli → Mel (6) above Eli? Wait, that’s impossible if positions are 1–7, because 6 is worse than 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  \n   • \"Above\" means better position → smaller number.  \n\n   • So Mel (6) above Eli → Eli must be worse than 6 → Eli must be 7.  \n\n   Yes! That’s the key: If Mel is 6th, and Mel finished above Eli, then Eli must be 7th.  \n\n6. Rob finished below Ada → Ada < Rob (smaller position number for Ada).  \n7. Eve finished 4th → Position 4: Eve.  \n\nFrom 5: Eli is 7th.  \n\nFrom 4: Rob above Eve → Rob’s position < 4. So Rob is in {1, 2, 3}. But position 1 is Joe, so Rob is in {2, 3}.  \n\nFrom 6: Ada < Rob → Ada’s position < Rob’s position.  \n• If Rob is 2 → Ada must be 1, but 1 is Joe → impossible.  \n\n• So Rob must be 3 → Ada must be 2.  \n\nSo:  \nPos 1: Joe  \nPos 2: Ada  \nPos 3: Rob  \nPos 4: Eve  \nPos 6: Mel  \nPos 7: Eli  \n\nRemaining position: 5 → must be Ana.  \n\nOrder: 1 Joe, 2 Ada, 3 Rob, 4 Eve, 5 Ana, 6 Mel, 7 Eli.  \n\nLast place = 7th = Eli.  \n\nThe correct option is: B\nAnswer:\nB\n\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.

Joe finished first → Joe is position 1.  \n2. Mel finished second-to-last → second-to-last is 6th place (since 7th is last). So Mel is 6th.  \n3. Rob finished above Eve → Rob < Eve in position number (smaller number = better).  \n4. Mel finished above Eli → Mel (6th) above Eli means Eli must be 7th (since only 7th is below 6th).  \n5. Rob finished below Ada → Ada < Rob in position number.  \n6. Eve finished fourth → Eve is 4th.  \n\nFrom (3) Rob above Eve → Rob’s position < 4 → Rob is 1, 2, or 3.  \nBut Joe is 1, so Rob is 2 or 3.  \n\nFrom (5) Ada < Rob → Ada is better than Rob → Ada must be 1 or 2 if Rob is 2 or 3.  \nBut Joe is 1, so Ada cannot be 1.  \n\nSo:  \n• If Rob is 2 → Ada must be 1 (impossible, Joe is 1) → contradiction.  \n\n• If Rob is 3 → Ada must be 1 or 2. Not 1 (Joe), so Ada must be 2.  \n\nSo: Ada = 2, Rob = 3, Eve = 4.  \n\nPositions so far:  \n1: Joe  \n2: Ada  \n3: Rob  \n4: Eve  \n6: Mel  \n7: Eli  \n\nRemaining position: 5th → must be Ana (only one left).  \n\nSo 4th place is Eve.  \n\nThe correct option is: E  \n\nThe correct option is: E\nAnswer:\nE\n\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.

Let’s rank from cheapest (1) to most expensive (5).  \n\nGiven facts:\n\n1. Kiwis are less expensive than mangoes:  K < M   \n2. Peaches are less expensive than oranges:  P < O   \n3. Oranges are the second-most expensive:  O = 4  (since 5 is most expensive, 4 is second-most expensive)  \n4. Mangoes are the second-cheapest:  M = 2  (since 1 is cheapest, 2 is second-cheapest)  \n\nStep 1 – Place M and O in the ranking:  \nRank positions: 1 (cheapest), 2, 3, 4, 5 (most expensive)  \n\nFrom (4):  M = 2   \nFrom (3):  O = 4   \n\nStep 2 – Use  K < M :  \n M = 2 , so  K < 2  ⇒  K = 1  (only possibility, since 1 is the only rank cheaper than 2).  \n\nSo  K = 1 ,  M = 2 .  \n\nStep 3 – Use  P < O :  \n O = 4 , so  P < 4 . Possible ranks for P: 1, 2, or 3.  \n\nBut rank 1 is K, rank 2 is M, so P cannot be 1 or 2 (unless two fruits share a rank, but logically consistent means unique order). So P must be 3.  \n\nThus  P = 3 .  \n\nStep 4 – Remaining fruit C takes the only empty spot:  \nFilled: K=1, M=2, P=3, O=4, so C=5.  \n\nOrder cheapest → most expensive:  \n1: K  \n2: M  \n3: P  \n4: O  \n5: C  \n\nStep 5 – Third-most expensive means rank 3 (since 5 is most expensive, 4 is second-most expensive, 3 is third-most expensive).  \nRank 3 = Peaches.  \n\nSo “Peaches are the third-most expensive” is true.  \n\nThe correct option is: E\nAnswer:\nE\n\n"}

Eve finished 4th → Position 4: Eve.  \n\nFrom 5: Eli is 7th.  \n\nFrom 4: Rob above Eve → Rob’s position < 4. So Rob is in {1, 2, 3}.

Eve finished first.  \n   Order so far: 1st: Eve, then 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th unknown.\n\n2. Rob finished above Mya.  \n   Rob > Mya in ranking (lower number = better finish).\n\n3.

Now fit Eve (1st) into the partial order Rob > Mya > Joe > Eli.  \n   Rob cannot be 1st because Eve is 1st, so Rob must be 2nd or later, but Rob must be above Mya, Mya above Joe, Joe above Eli.  \n   Let’s test possible positions:  \n   • If Rob is 2nd, then Mya is after Rob (3rd, 4th, or 5th), but Mya must be above Joe, Joe above Eli.  \n\n     So possible: Rob (2nd), Mya (3rd), Joe (4th), Eli (5th).  \n   • Check: Eve (1st), Rob (2nd), Mya (3rd), Joe (4th), Eli (5th).  \n\n     All conditions satisfied:  \n     Rob > Mya ✓, Joe > Eli ✓, Joe below Mya ✓, Eve 1st ✓.  \n\n6. Who is last?  \n   In this arrangement, Eli is last.  \n\nSo the true statement: Eli finished last.  \n\nThe correct option is: B\nAnswer:\nB\n\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.\n\nOn a branch, there are five birds: a hawk, a raven, a robin, a hummingbird, and a crow. The robin is the leftmost. The raven is the second from the left. The hawk is the second from the right. The crow is the third from the left.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is true?\nOptions:\nA) The hawk is the second from the right.\nB) The raven is the second from the right.\nC) The robin is the second from the right.\nD) The hummingbird is the second from the right.\nE) The crow is the second from the right.\nReasoning:\nLet’s reason through the fixed order step by step.  \n\nWe have 5 positions: 1 (leftmost) to 5 (rightmost).  \n\n1. \"The robin is the leftmost\" → Position 1: Robin.  \n2. \"The raven is the second from the left\" → Position 2: Raven.  \n3. \"The crow is the third from the left\" → Position 3: Crow.  \n4. \"The hawk is the second from the right\" → Second from the right means position 4 (since position 5 is rightmost). So Position 4: Hawk.  \n5. Remaining bird (hummingbird) goes in Position 5.  \n\nOrder:  \n1: Robin  \n2: Raven  \n3: Crow  \n4: Hawk  \n5: Hummingbird  \n\nNow check the options:  \nA) The hawk is the second from the right. → Yes, that’s true (position 4).  \nB) Raven is second from the right? → No, Raven is position 2.  \nC) Robin is second from the right? → No, Robin is position 1.  \nD) Hummingbird is second from the right? → No, Hummingbird is position 5.  \nE) Crow is second from the right? → No, Crow is position 3.  \n\nOnly A is correct.  \n\nThe correct option is: A\nAnswer:\nA\n\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.\n\nIn a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Joe, Eli, Ada, Mel, Eve, Rob, and Ana. Joe finished first. Mel finished second-to-last. Rob finished above Eve. Mel finished above Eli. Rob finished below Ada. Eve finished fourth.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is true?\nOptions:\nA) Joe finished last.\nB) Eli finished last.\nC) Ada finished last.\nD) Mel finished last.\nE) Eve finished last.\nF) Rob finished last.\nG) Ana finished last.\nReasoning:\nLet’s break it down step by step.  \n\nKnown facts:  \n1. There are 7 golfers: Joe, Eli, Ada, Mel, Eve, Rob, Ana.  \n2. Joe finished first → Position 1: Joe.  \n3. Mel finished second-to-last → Position 6: Mel.  \n4. Rob finished above Eve → Rob < Eve in position numbers (smaller position number = better finish).  \n5. Mel finished above Eli → Mel < Eli → Mel (6) above Eli? Wait, that’s impossible if positions are 1–7, because 6 is worse than 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  \n   • \"Above\" means better position → smaller number.  \n\n   • So Mel (6) above Eli → Eli must be worse than 6 → Eli must be 7.  \n\n   Yes! That’s the key: If Mel is 6th, and Mel finished above Eli, then Eli must be 7th.  \n\n6. Rob finished below Ada → Ada < Rob (smaller position number for Ada).  \n7. Eve finished 4th → Position 4: Eve.  \n\nFrom 5: Eli is 7th.  \n\nFrom 4: Rob above Eve → Rob’s position < 4. So Rob is in {1, 2, 3}. But position 1 is Joe, so Rob is in {2, 3}.  \n\nFrom 6: Ada < Rob → Ada’s position < Rob’s position.  \n• If Rob is 2 → Ada must be 1, but 1 is Joe → impossible.  \n\n• So Rob must be 3 → Ada must be 2.  \n\nSo:  \nPos 1: Joe  \nPos 2: Ada  \nPos 3: Rob  \nPos 4: Eve  \nPos 6: Mel  \nPos 7: Eli  \n\nRemaining position: 5 → must be Ana.  \n\nOrder: 1 Joe, 2 Ada, 3 Rob, 4 Eve, 5 Ana, 6 Mel, 7 Eli.  \n\nLast place = 7th = Eli.  \n\nThe correct option is: B\nAnswer:\nB\n\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.

Joe finished first → Joe is position 1.  \n2. Mel finished second-to-last → second-to-last is 6th place (since 7th is last). So Mel is 6th.  \n3. Rob finished above Eve → Rob < Eve in position number (smaller number = better).  \n4. Mel finished above Eli → Mel (6th) above Eli means Eli must be 7th (since only 7th is below 6th).  \n5. Rob finished below Ada → Ada < Rob in position number.  \n6. Eve finished fourth → Eve is 4th.  \n\nFrom (3) Rob above Eve → Rob’s position < 4 → Rob is 1, 2, or 3.  \nBut Joe is 1, so Rob is 2 or 3.  \n\nFrom (5) Ada < Rob → Ada is better than Rob → Ada must be 1 or 2 if Rob is 2 or 3.  \nBut Joe is 1, so Ada cannot be 1.  \n\nSo:  \n• If Rob is 2 → Ada must be 1 (impossible, Joe is 1) → contradiction.  \n\n• If Rob is 3 → Ada must be 1 or 2. Not 1 (Joe), so Ada must be 2.  \n\nSo: Ada = 2, Rob = 3, Eve = 4.  \n\nPositions so far:  \n1: Joe  \n2: Ada  \n3: Rob  \n4: Eve  \n6: Mel  \n7: Eli  \n\nRemaining position: 5th → must be Ana (only one left).  \n\nSo 4th place is Eve.  \n\nThe correct option is: E  \n\nThe correct option is: E\nAnswer:\nE\n\n"}

Amy finished third:  \n   Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 → Amy is 3rd.\n\n2. Ana finished second-to-last:  \n   Second-to-last means 4th place (since there are 5 golfers). So Ana is 4th.\n\n3. Dan finished above Eve: Dan < Eve in ranking? No — \"finished above\" means better position → smaller position number. So Dan’s position number < Eve’s position number.\n\n4. Dan finished below Mya: Mya’s position number < Dan’s position number.\n\nFrom 3 and 4:  \nMya < Dan < Eve in position numbers (smaller number = higher finish).\n\nSo Mya, Dan, Eve are in that order in the ranking (not necessarily consecutive, but Mya before Dan before Eve).\n\nPossible positions:  \nWe know: Amy = 3, Ana = 4.  \nSo remaining positions: 1, 2, 5.\n\nMya, Dan, Eve must occupy three positions in that order: Mya first, then Dan, then Eve.\n\nThe only way Mya < Dan < Eve works with positions {1, 2, 5} is:  \nMya = 1, Dan = 2, Eve = 5.\n\nCheck:  \n1: Mya  \n2: Dan  \n3: Amy  \n4: Ana  \n5: Eve  \n\nThis satisfies all: Dan above Eve (2 < 5), Dan below Mya (2 > 1? Wait — \"Dan finished below Mya\" means worse position than Mya → Dan’s position number > Mya’s. Yes, 2 > 1, so Dan below Mya is satisfied.)  \nAmy 3rd, Ana 4th.\n\nSo last place (5th) is Eve.\n\nThe correct option is: C\nAnswer:\nC\n\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.\n\nIn a golf tournament, there were five golfers: Rob, Amy, Eve, Mya, and Ana. Mya finished below Rob. Ana finished below Eve. Amy finished second. Eve finished below Mya.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is true?\nOptions:\nA) Rob finished second-to-last.\nB) Amy finished second-to-last.\nC) Eve finished second-to-last.\nD) Mya finished second-to-last.\nE) Ana finished second-to-last.\nReasoning:\nLet’s reason through the clues step by step.  \n\nWe have 5 golfers: Rob, Amy, Eve, Mya, Ana.  \nPositions: 1st (highest) to 5th (lowest).  \n\n1. Amy finished second → Amy is in position 2.  \n2. Mya finished below Rob → Rob finished above Mya.  \n3. Ana finished below Eve → Eve finished above Ana.  \n4. Eve finished below Mya → Mya finished above Eve.  \n\nFrom 2 and 4:  \nRob > Mya > Eve.  \n\nFrom 3: Eve > Ana.  \n\nSo: Rob > Mya > Eve > Ana.  \n\nAmy is fixed at position 2.  \n\nLet’s try to fit Rob, Mya, Eve, Ana around Amy’s position 2.  \n\nIf Amy is 2nd, then 1st must be someone else.  \n\nRob is above Mya, Eve, and Ana. Could Rob be 1st?  \nIf Rob is 1st:  \nThen Mya is below Rob, so Mya could be 3rd, 4th, or 5th. But Mya > Eve > Ana.  \nSo Mya can’t be 5th (because then Eve and Ana would be below her but there’d be no room for both below her if she’s last). Let’s check systematically:  \n\nWe have positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  \nPos 2 = Amy.  \n\nRob = pos 1.  \nMya must be below Rob but above Eve.  \nEve must be above Ana.  \n\nPossible arrangement:  \n1: Rob  \n2: Amy  \n3: Mya  \n4: Eve  \n5: Ana  \n\nCheck:  \nMya below Rob? Yes (3 vs 1).  \nAna below Eve? Yes (5 vs 4).  \nAmy second? Yes.  \nEve below Mya? Yes (4 vs 3).  \n\nAll consistent.  \n\nSecond-to-last means 4th place.  \n4th place = Eve.  \n\nSo Eve finished second-to-last.  \n\nThe correct option is: C\nAnswer:\nC\n\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.\n\nIn a golf tournament, there were five golfers: Mel, Dan, Amy, Joe, and Eve. Amy finished below Dan. Mel finished first. Joe finished above Dan. Eve finished last.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is true?\nOptions:\nA) Mel finished last.\nB) Dan finished last.\nC) Amy finished last.\nD) Joe finished last.\nE) Eve finished last.\nReasoning:\nLet’s reason it out step by step.  \n\n1. Fixed order of 5 golfers: Mel, Dan, Amy, Joe, Eve.  \n2. Mel finished first → Mel is in position 1.  \n3. Eve finished last → Eve is in position 5.  \n4. Amy finished below Dan → Dan’s position number is smaller than Amy’s (lower number = better finish).  \n5. Joe finished above Dan → Joe’s position number is smaller than Dan’s.  \n\nSo:  \n• Joe is above Dan.  \n\n• Dan is above Amy.  \n\n• Amy is above Eve? Not necessarily — but Eve is last, so Amy must be above Eve unless Amy is 4th and Eve 5th.  \n\nLet’s try ordering:  \n\nPositions: 1 = Mel, 5 = Eve.  \n\nJoe > Dan > Amy in terms of position numbers (smaller is better).  \nSo possible positions:  \n• Joe could be 2, Dan 3, Amy 4.  \n\n• Check: Joe (2) > Dan (3) > Amy (4) > Eve (5) — yes, works.  \n\n• Could Joe be 1? No, Mel is 1.  \n\nSo: 1: Mel, 2: Joe, 3: Dan, 4: Amy, 5: Eve.  \n\nThus Eve finished last.  \n\nThe correct option is: E\nAnswer:\nE\n\n"}

Amy finished second → Amy is in position 2.  \n2. Mya finished below Rob → Rob finished above Mya.  \n3. Ana finished below Eve → Eve finished above Ana.  \n4. Eve finished below Mya → Mya finished above Eve.  \n\nFrom 2 and 4:  \nRob > Mya > Eve.  \n\nFrom 3: Eve > Ana.  \n\nSo: Rob > Mya > Eve > Ana.  \n\nAmy is fixed at position 2.  \n\nLet’s try to fit Rob, Mya, Eve, Ana around Amy’s position 2.  \n\nIf Amy is 2nd, then 1st must be someone else.  \n\nRob is above Mya, Eve, and Ana. Could Rob be 1st?  \nIf Rob is 1st:  \nThen Mya is below Rob, so Mya could be 3rd, 4th, or 5th. But Mya > Eve > Ana.  \nSo Mya can’t be 5th (because then Eve and Ana would be below her but there’d be no room for both below her if she’s last). Let’s check systematically:  \n\nWe have positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  \nPos 2 = Amy.  \n\nRob = pos 1.  \nMya must be below Rob but above Eve.  \nEve must be above Ana.  \n\nPossible arrangement:  \n1: Rob  \n2: Amy  \n3: Mya  \n4: Eve  \n5: Ana  \n\nCheck:  \nMya below Rob?

Fixed order of 5 golfers: Mel, Dan, Amy, Joe, Eve.  \n2. Mel finished first → Mel is in position 1.  \n3. Eve finished last → Eve is in position 5.  \n4. Amy finished below Dan → Dan’s position number is smaller than Amy’s (lower number = better finish).  \n5. Joe finished above Dan → Joe’s position number is smaller than Dan’s.  \n\nSo:  \n• Joe is above Dan.  \n\n• Dan is above Amy.  \n\n• Amy is above Eve? Not necessarily — but Eve is last, so Amy must be above Eve unless Amy is 4th and Eve 5th.  \n\nLet’s try ordering:  \n\nPositions: 1 = Mel, 5 = Eve.  \n\nJoe > Dan > Amy in terms of position numbers (smaller is better).  \nSo possible positions:  \n• Joe could be 2, Dan 3, Amy 4.  \n\n• Check: Joe (2) > Dan (3) > Amy (4) > Eve (5) — yes, works.  \n\n• Could Joe be 1? No, Mel is 1.  \n\nSo: 1: Mel, 2: Joe, 3: Dan, 4: Amy, 5: Eve.  \n\nThus Eve finished last.  \n\nThe correct option is: E\nAnswer:\nE\n\n"}

Apples are less expensive than cantaloupes:  \n   C > A  (Cantaloupes more expensive than Apples).\n\n2. Apples are more expensive than peaches:  \n   A > Ps.\n\n3. Mangoes are the 4th-most expensive:  \n   M = 4.\n\n4. Peaches are more expensive than plums:  \n   Ps > P.\n\n5. Pears are the 3rd-most expensive:  \n   Pe = 3.\n\n6. Loquats are the 3rd-cheapest:  \n   Loquats = 5th (because 3rd-cheapest means 5th in order from most expensive to least: ranks 1–7, cheapest is rank 7, 2nd-cheapest is rank 6, 3rd-cheapest is rank 5).  \n   So L = 5.\n\nStep 1 – Fill known ranks:  \nRank 3: Pe  \nRank 4: M  \nRank 5: L  \n\nRemaining ranks: 1, 2, 6, 7 for fruits C, A, Ps, P.\n\nStep 2 – Use inequalities:  \nFrom C > A > Ps > P:  \nOrder among these four: C most expensive of the four, then A, then Ps, then P cheapest of the four.\n\nSo in the remaining set {C, A, Ps, P}, the order is:  \nC > A > Ps > P.\n\nStep 3 – Assign ranks 1, 2, 6, 7 to C, A, Ps, P in that order:  \nC must be rank 1 or 2 (since C > A and ranks left are 1, 2, 6, 7; if C were rank 6 or 7, impossible because A would be even lower, but A must be higher than Ps and P).  \nActually check: Ranks left: 1, 2, 6, 7.  \nC > A > Ps > P.  \nSo highest rank (smallest number = most expensive) goes to C, then A, then Ps, then P.  \nThus:  \nC = rank 1 or 2? Wait, but ranks available are 1, 2, 6, 7.  \nIf C = rank 1, then A = rank 2 (since A is next in order and ranks 6,7 are lower than 2, so A can’t be 6 or 7 if Ps and P are below A).  \nThen Ps = rank 6, P = rank 7.  \nThat fits: C=1, A=2, Ps=6, P=7.  \n\nIf C = rank 2, then A would have to be rank 6 or 7? No, that’s impossible because A > Ps > P, so A must be higher rank (smaller number) than Ps and P.  \nBut if C=2, then available ranks for A are {6,7} if 1 is taken by something else? But rank 1 is not taken by C in that case, so who is rank 1?  \nWe must check: Ranks 3,4,5 are taken by Pe, M, L. So rank 1 and 2 are open for C and maybe A.  \nIf C=2, then rank 1 must be one of the fruits that are not C, A, Ps, P — but fruits not in {C, A, Ps, P} are Pe, M, L, whose ranks are fixed at 3,4,5. So rank 1 must be one of C, A, Ps, P. But C is the most expensive of all fruits? Not necessarily, but is it possible something outside this set is rank 1? No — all fruits are in that set or in {Pe, M, L}. So possible rank 1 fruits: C, A, Ps, P, or Pe, M, L. But Pe=3, M=4, L=5, so they can’t be rank 1. So rank 1 must be C, A, Ps, or P. But C > A > Ps > P, so only C can be rank 1.  \nThus C = 1 necessarily.  \n\nSo C = 1.  \n\nThen A = 2 (since A is next in the chain and ranks left for {A, Ps, P} are 2, 6, 7; A must be the highest of these three, so A=2).  \nThen Ps = 6, P = 7.  \n\nStep 4 – Check full order:  \n1: C  \n2: A  \n3: Pe  \n4: M  \n5: L  \n6: Ps  \n7: P  \n\nAll conditions satisfied:  \nC > A ✓ (1>2)  \nA > Ps ✓ (2>6)  \nM=4 ✓  \nPs > P ✓ (6>7)  \nPe=3 ✓  \nL=5 ✓  \n\nStep 5 – Answer the question:  \nSecond-most expensive = rank 2 = Apples.  \n\nThe correct option is: D\nAnswer:\nD\n\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.

Let’s check:  \n\nPositions filled: 1=M, 2=Pc, 4=L, 7=Pl.  \nPositions open: 3, 5, 6.  \n\nBut we have 3 fruits left: A, Pe, K. That’s only 3 fruits for 3 spots. Good.\n\nWe know A > Pe > K.  \nSo possible assignments of {3,5,6} to A, Pe, K respecting A < Pe < K in rank numbers? Wait — careful: \"more expensive\" means rank number is smaller.  \n\nA > Pe means rank#(A) < rank#(Pe).  \nPe > K means rank#(Pe) < rank#(K).  \n\nSo in order of expensiveness: A most expensive of the three, then Pe, then K least expensive of the three.  \n\nSo among positions 3,5,6 (where 3 is most expensive of these three spots, 6 is cheapest of these three spots), we must have:  \nA in 3, Pe in 5, K in 6.  \nThat fits: 3(A) > 5(Pe) > 6(K) in expensiveness.\n\nSo final order:  \n1: Mangoes  \n2: Peaches  \n3: Apples  \n4: Loquats  \n5: Pears  \n6: Kiwis  \n7: Plums  \n\nCheapest = Plums (position 7).  \n\nLooking at the options:  \nF) The plums are the cheapest.  \n\nThe correct option is: F\nAnswer:\nF\n\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.\n\nA fruit stand sells seven fruits: mangoes, cantaloupes, apples, plums, loquats, watermelons, and peaches. The plums are more expensive than the mangoes. The watermelons are more expensive than the loquats. The loquats are the second-cheapest. The plums are less expensive than the peaches. The mangoes are the fourth-most expensive. The peaches are less expensive than the cantaloupes.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is true?\nOptions:\nA) The mangoes are the cheapest.\nB) The cantaloupes are the cheapest.\nC) The apples are the cheapest.\nD) The plums are the cheapest.\nE) The loquats are the cheapest.\nF) The watermelons are the cheapest.\nG) The peaches are the cheapest.\nReasoning:\nLet’s go step by step.  \n\nWe have 7 fruits: mangoes (M), cantaloupes (C), apples (A), plums (P), loquats (L), watermelons (W), peaches (Pe).  \nFrom cheapest (1) to most expensive (7):  \n\n1. Loquats are the second-cheapest.  \n   So: L = 2nd cheapest (rank 2 in price, with rank 1 being cheapest).  \n\n2. Mangoes are the fourth-most expensive.  \n   There are 7 fruits, so 4th most expensive = 4th from the top in price = rank 4 in ascending price order? Wait, check:  \n   \"Fourth-most expensive\" means: most expensive = rank 7, second most expensive = rank 6, third most expensive = rank 5, fourth most expensive = rank 4.  \n   So M = rank 4.  \n\n3. Plums more expensive than mangoes: P > M (M rank 4, so P rank 5, 6, or 7).  \n\n4. Plums less expensive than peaches: P < Pe, so Pe > P.  \n\n5. Peaches less expensive than cantaloupes: Pe < C, so C > Pe.  \n\nFrom 3–5: M(4) < P < Pe < C.  \nSo P rank ≥ 5, Pe rank ≥ 6, C rank = 7.  \nThus C = rank 7 (most expensive), Pe = rank 6, P = rank 5.  \n\nSo far:  \nRank 1: ?  \nRank 2: L  \nRank 3: ?  \nRank 4: M  \nRank 5: P  \nRank 6: Pe  \nRank 7: C  \n\n6. Watermelons more expensive than loquats: W > L (L rank 2, so W rank ≥ 3).  \n\nRemaining fruits: apples (A), watermelons (W), and the unknown at rank 1 and rank 3.  \nFruits left to place: A, W, and the one at rank 1 (which could be A or W or the other fruits not yet placed? Wait, all fruits: M, C, A, P, L, W, Pe.  \nPlaced: L(2), M(4), P(5), Pe(6), C(7).  \nUnplaced: A, W, and the fruit at rank 1 and rank 3.  \n\nSo ranks 1 and 3 are from {A, W, and the remaining fruit?} Actually all 7: M, C, A, P, L, W, Pe.  \nPlaced: C(7), Pe(6), P(5), M(4), L(2).  \nLeft: A, W, and the fruit for rank 1 and rank 3.  \nSo rank 1 and rank 3 are A and W in some order.  \n\nBut W > L (rank 2), so W cannot be rank 1.  \nThus W must be rank 3.  \nThen rank 1 must be A.  \n\nSo:  \nRank 1: A (apples)  \nRank 2: L  \nRank 3: W  \nRank 4: M  \nRank 5: P  \nRank 6: Pe  \nRank 7: C  \n\nThus the cheapest is apples.  \n\nQuestion asks: Which is true?

Dan finished 2nd.  \n2. Amy finished below Eve → Eve > Amy (in position number: smaller number = better finish).  \n3. Dan finished above Eve → Dan (2nd) > Eve → Eve’s position > 2 → Eve is 3rd, 4th, or 5th.  \n4. Amy finished above Eli → Amy > Eli.  \n\nFrom (3): Dan (2nd) > Eve → Eve’s position is at least 3rd.  \nFrom (2): Eve > Amy → Amy’s position is worse than Eve’s.  \nFrom (4): Amy > Eli → Eli is worse than Amy.  \n\nSo: Eve > Amy > Eli in finishing order (lower positions for Eve, then Amy, then Eli).  \n\nPossible positions for Eve:  \n• If Eve = 3rd → Amy = 4th or 5th? Wait, Amy > Eli, so if Eve=3, Amy=4 or 5, Eli=5 or lower (impossible since only 5 spots). Let’s check:  \n\nWe have 5 spots: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  \nDan = 2.  \nEve = 3 → Amy = 4 or 5. But Amy > Eli → Eli must be worse than Amy. If Amy=4, Eli=5. If Amy=5, Eli can’t be worse, so impossible. So Amy=4, Eli=5.  \n\nThen positions:  \n1: ?  \n2: Dan  \n3: Eve  \n4: Amy  \n5: Eli  \n\nRemaining position 1: Rob.  \n\nCheck:  \nRob=1, Dan=2, Eve=3, Amy=4, Eli=5.  \nAll conditions satisfied:  \n• Dan 2nd ✓  \n\n• Amy below Eve (4 vs 3) ✓  \n\n• Dan above Eve (2 vs 3) ✓  \n\n• Amy above Eli (4 vs 5) ✓  \n\nSo this works.  \n\nCould Eve be 4th?  \nIf Eve=4 → Amy=5 (since Amy below Eve, and Amy > Eli, but if Amy=5, Eli can’t be worse, so impossible). So Eve cannot be 4th or 5th.  \n\nThus only possibility: Eve = 3rd.  \n\nThe question asks: Which is true?  \nOptions:  \nA) Rob 3rd — no, Rob is 1st.  \nB) Eve 3rd — yes.  \nC) Eli 3rd — no, Eli 5th.  \nD) Amy 3rd — no, Amy 4th.  \nE) Dan 3rd — no, Dan 2nd.  \n\nThe correct option is: B\nAnswer:\nB\n\n"}

Could Rob be 1st?  \nIf Rob is 1st:  \nThen Mya is below Rob, so Mya could be 3rd, 4th, or 5th. But Mya > Eve > Ana.  \nSo Mya can’t be 5th (because then Eve and Ana would be below her but there’d be no room for both below her if she’s last).

Eve finished first.  \n   Order so far: 1st: Eve, then 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th unknown.\n\n2. Rob finished above Mya.  \n   Rob > Mya in ranking (lower number = better finish).\n\n3. Joe finished above Eli.  \n   Joe > Eli.\n\n4. Joe finished below Mya.  \n   Mya > Joe.  \n   Combined with Joe > Eli: Mya > Joe > Eli.  \n   Combined with Rob > Mya: Rob > Mya > Joe > Eli.\n\n5. Now fit Eve (1st) into the partial order Rob > Mya > Joe > Eli.  \n   Rob cannot be 1st because Eve is 1st, so Rob must be 2nd or later, but Rob must be above Mya, Mya above Joe, Joe above Eli.  \n   Let’s test possible positions:  \n   • If Rob is 2nd, then Mya is after Rob (3rd, 4th, or 5th), but Mya must be above Joe, Joe above Eli.  \n\n     So possible: Rob (2nd), Mya (3rd), Joe (4th), Eli (5th).  \n   • Check: Eve (1st), Rob (2nd), Mya (3rd), Joe (4th), Eli (5th).  \n\n     All conditions satisfied:  \n     Rob > Mya ✓, Joe > Eli ✓, Joe below Mya ✓, Eve 1st ✓.  \n\n6.

Known positions explicitly given:  \n   • Eve finished 1st.  \n\n   • Joe finished 3rd.  \n\n   • Dan finished last (7th).  \n\n   • Rob finished third-to-last → 7th, 6th, 5th are last positions, so third-to-last means 5th.  \n\n2. Relative positions:  \n   • Ada finished above Joe → Ada is 1st or 2nd (but 1st is Eve), so Ada must be 2nd.  \n\n   • Mel finished below Rob → Rob is 5th, so Mel is 6th (since 7th is Dan).  \n\n3. Remaining positions:  \n   • Positions filled so far: 1=Eve, 2=Ada, 3=Joe, 5=Rob, 6=Mel, 7=Dan.  \n\n   • Missing position: 4th → only Amy is left unassigned.  \n\nSo Amy finished 4th.  \n\nThe correct option is: A\nAnswer:\nA\n\n"}

Possible ranks for P: 1, 2, or 3.  \n\nBut rank 1 is K, rank 2 is M, so P cannot be 1 or 2 (unless two fruits share a rank, but logically consistent means unique order).

Let’s rank from cheapest (1) to most expensive (5).  \n\nGiven facts:\n\n1. Kiwis are less expensive than mangoes:  K < M   \n2. Peaches are less expensive than oranges:  P < O   \n3. Oranges are the second-most expensive:  O = 4  (since 5 is most expensive, 4 is second-most expensive)  \n4.

Possible ranks for P: 1, 2, or 3.  \n\nBut rank 1 is K, rank 2 is M, so P cannot be 1 or 2 (unless two fruits share a rank, but logically consistent means unique order). So P must be 3.  \n\nThus  P = 3 .  \n\nStep 4 – Remaining fruit C takes the only empty spot:  \nFilled: K=1, M=2, P=3, O=4, so C=5.  \n\nOrder cheapest → most expensive:  \n1: K  \n2: M  \n3: P  \n4: O  \n5: C  \n\nStep 5 – Third-most expensive means rank 3 (since 5 is most expensive, 4 is second-most expensive, 3 is third-most expensive).  \nRank 3 = Peaches.  \n\nSo “Peaches are the third-most expensive” is true.  \n\nThe correct option is: E\nAnswer:\nE\n\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.

Fixed order of 5 golfers: Mel, Dan, Amy, Joe, Eve.  \n2. Mel finished first → Mel is in position 1.  \n3. Eve finished last → Eve is in position 5.  \n4.

Amy finished third:  \n   Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 → Amy is 3rd.\n\n2. Ana finished second-to-last:  \n   Second-to-last means 4th place (since there are 5 golfers). So Ana is 4th.\n\n3. Dan finished above Eve: Dan < Eve in ranking? No — \"finished above\" means better position → smaller position number. So Dan’s position number < Eve’s position number.\n\n4. Dan finished below Mya: Mya’s position number < Dan’s position number.\n\nFrom 3 and 4:  \nMya < Dan < Eve in position numbers (smaller number = higher finish).\n\nSo Mya, Dan, Eve are in that order in the ranking (not necessarily consecutive, but Mya before Dan before Eve).\n\nPossible positions:  \nWe know: Amy = 3, Ana = 4.  \nSo remaining positions: 1, 2, 5.\n\nMya, Dan, Eve must occupy three positions in that order: Mya first, then Dan, then Eve.\n\nThe only way Mya < Dan < Eve works with positions {1, 2, 5} is:  \nMya = 1, Dan = 2, Eve = 5.\n\nCheck:  \n1: Mya  \n2: Dan  \n3: Amy  \n4: Ana  \n5: Eve  \n\nThis satisfies all: Dan above Eve (2 < 5), Dan below Mya (2 > 1? Wait — \"Dan finished below Mya\" means worse position than Mya → Dan’s position number > Mya’s.

Ada finished above Mya. (Ada < Mya in position numbers, but better in rank means smaller position number.)  \n2. Eli finished below Joe. (Joe < Eli in rank, i.e., Joe better than Eli.)  \n3. Eli finished above Eve. (Eli < Eve in rank, i.e., Eli better than Eve.)  \n4. Ada finished second-to-last → position 6.  \n5. Mel finished third → position 3.  \n6. Rob finished fourth → position 4.  \n\nStep 1 – Fixed positions:  \nPositions known:  \n3: Mel  \n4: Rob  \n6: Ada  \n\nStep 2 – Ada above Mya:  \nAda is 6th, so Mya must be below her → Mya is 7th.  \n\nSo:  \n6: Ada  \n7: Mya  \n\nStep 3 – Joe > Eli > Eve in rank (Joe better than Eli better than Eve).  \nSo Joe’s position number < Eli’s position number < Eve’s position number.  \n\nPositions left: 1, 2, 5.  \nWe must fit Joe, Eli, Eve into three positions with Joe best, then Eli, then Eve.  \n\nSo:  \nJoe → 1st  \nEli → 2nd  \nEve → 5th  \n\nThat satisfies Joe > Eli > Eve.  \n\nStep 4 – Check:  \n1: Joe  \n2: Eli  \n3: Mel  \n4: Rob  \n5: Eve  \n6: Ada  \n7: Mya  \n\nAll conditions:  \n• Ada above Mya (6 vs 7) ✅  \n\n• Eli below Joe (2 vs 1) ✅  \n\n• Eli above Eve (2 vs 5) ✅  \n\n• Ada 6th ✅  \n\n• Mel 3rd ✅  \n\n• Rob 4th ✅  \n\nStep 5 – Answer the question:  \nWho finished second?

Ada finished second-to-last → Ada is 6th.  \n2. Mel finished 3rd.  \n3. Rob finished 4th.  \n4. Ada finished above Mya → Mya is 7th (since Ada is 6th, only 7th is below her).  \n5. Eli finished below Joe → Joe’s position number < Eli’s position number.  \n6. Eli finished above Eve → Eli’s position number < Eve’s position number.  \n\nFrom (5) and (6): Joe > Eli > Eve in finishing order (meaning Joe ahead of Eli ahead of Eve).  \nSo Joe’s position number < Eli’s position number < Eve’s position number.  \n\nPositions known:  \n3rd = Mel  \n4th = Rob  \n6th = Ada  \n7th = Mya  \n\nRemaining positions: 1, 2, 5.  \n\nJoe, Eli, Eve must occupy 3 distinct positions with Joe < Eli < Eve in rank (smaller position number = better finish).  \n\nPossible triple from {1, 2, 5} in increasing position number:  \nJoe = 1, Eli = 2, Eve = 5 works (since 1 < 2 < 5).  \nCheck if any other arrangement works:  \nIf Joe = 1, Eli = 5, Eve = ? — but Eve must be > Eli, so Eve would need position 6 or 7, but 6 and 7 are taken by Ada and Mya. So impossible.  \nIf Joe = 2, Eli = 5, Eve would need >5 → only 6 or 7 free, but 6 and 7 taken. So impossible.  \nSo only possibility: Joe 1st, Eli 2nd, Eve 5th.  \n\nFinal order:  \n1: Joe  \n2: Eli  \n3: Mel  \n4: Rob  \n5: Eve  \n6: Ada  \n7: Mya  \n\nSecond-to-last = 6th place = Ada.  \n\nThe question asks: Which of the following is true?  \nOptions list A through G, each claiming “X finished second-to-last.”  \nFrom our list, Ada finished second-to-last, which is option G.  \n\nThe correct option is: G\nAnswer:\nG\n\n"}

(Given explicitly.)  \n\n• Amy finished third. (Given.)  \n\n• Mel finished last (7th).  \n\n• Ana finished third-to-last (i.e., 5th place out of 7).  \n\nSo far:  \n1: ?  \n2: Dan  \n3: Amy  \n4: ?  \n5: Ana  \n6: ?  \n7: Mel  \n\nStep 2 – Other constraints  \n• Eve finished above Amy → Eve must be in position 1 or 2, but 2 is Dan, so Eve must be 1st.  \n\nNow:  \n1: Eve  \n2: Dan  \n3: Amy  \n4: ?  \n5: Ana  \n6: ?  \n7: Mel  \n\n• Ada finished below Ana → Ana is 5th, so Ada must be 6th (since 7th is Mel).  \n\nNow:  \n1: Eve  \n2: Dan  \n3: Amy  \n4: Joe (only one left for this spot)  \n5: Ana  \n6: Ada  \n7: Mel  \n\nStep 3 – Check the options  \nOption B says: Dan finished second. This matches our table.  \n\nStep 4 – Verify no contradictions  \nAll conditions satisfied:  \n• Eve above Amy ✓ (1 vs 3)  \n\n• Dan 2nd ✓  \n\n• Ada below Ana ✓ (6 vs 5)  \n\n• Ana 5th (third-to-last) ✓  \n\n• Mel last ✓  \n\n• Amy 3rd ✓  \n\nStep 5 – Conclusion  \nThe correct option is B.  \n\nThe correct option is: B\nAnswer:\nB\n\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.

Amy finished above Eli.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is true?\nOptions:\nA) Rob finished third.\nB) Eve finished third.\nC) Eli finished third.\nD) Amy finished third.\nE) Dan finished third.\nReasoning:\nLet’s reason it out step by step.  \n\nWe have 5 golfers: Rob, Eve, Eli, Amy, Dan.  \nPositions: 1st (highest) to 5th (lowest).  \n\nGiven facts:  \n1. Dan finished 2nd.  \n2. Amy finished below Eve → Eve > Amy (in position number: smaller number = better finish).  \n3. Dan finished above Eve → Dan (2nd) > Eve → Eve’s position > 2 → Eve is 3rd, 4th, or 5th.  \n4. Amy finished above Eli → Amy > Eli.  \n\nFrom (3): Dan (2nd) > Eve → Eve’s position is at least 3rd.  \nFrom (2): Eve > Amy → Amy’s position is worse than Eve’s.  \nFrom (4): Amy > Eli → Eli is worse than Amy.  \n\nSo: Eve > Amy > Eli in finishing order (lower positions for Eve, then Amy, then Eli).  \n\nPossible positions for Eve:  \n• If Eve = 3rd → Amy = 4th or 5th? Wait, Amy > Eli, so if Eve=3, Amy=4 or 5, Eli=5 or lower (impossible since only 5 spots). Let’s check:  \n\nWe have 5 spots: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  \nDan = 2.  \nEve = 3 → Amy = 4 or 5. But Amy > Eli → Eli must be worse than Amy. If Amy=4, Eli=5. If Amy=5, Eli can’t be worse, so impossible. So Amy=4, Eli=5.  \n\nThen positions:  \n1: ?  \n2: Dan  \n3: Eve  \n4: Amy  \n5: Eli  \n\nRemaining position 1: Rob.  \n\nCheck:  \nRob=1, Dan=2, Eve=3, Amy=4, Eli=5.  \nAll conditions satisfied:  \n• Dan 2nd ✓  \n\n• Amy below Eve (4 vs 3) ✓  \n\n• Dan above Eve (2 vs 3) ✓  \n\n• Amy above Eli (4 vs 5) ✓  \n\nSo this works.  \n\nCould Eve be 4th?  \nIf Eve=4 → Amy=5 (since Amy below Eve, and Amy > Eli, but if Amy=5, Eli can’t be worse, so impossible). So Eve cannot be 4th or 5th.  \n\nThus only possibility: Eve = 3rd.  \n\nThe question asks: Which is true?  \nOptions:  \nA) Rob 3rd — no, Rob is 1st.  \nB) Eve 3rd — yes.  \nC) Eli 3rd — no, Eli 5th.  \nD) Amy 3rd — no, Amy 4th.  \nE) Dan 3rd — no, Dan 2nd.  \n\nThe correct option is: B\nAnswer:\nB\n\n"}

(Given explicitly.)  \n\n• Amy finished third. (Given.)  \n\n• Mel finished last (7th).  \n\n• Ana finished third-to-last (i.e., 5th place out of 7).  \n\nSo far:  \n1: ?  \n2: Dan  \n3: Amy  \n4: ?  \n5: Ana  \n6: ?  \n7: Mel  \n\nStep 2 – Other constraints  \n• Eve finished above Amy → Eve must be in position 1 or 2, but 2 is Dan, so Eve must be 1st.  \n\nNow:  \n1: Eve  \n2: Dan  \n3: Amy  \n4: ?  \n5: Ana  \n6: ?  \n7: Mel  \n\n• Ada finished below Ana → Ana is 5th, so Ada must be 6th (since 7th is Mel).  \n\nNow:  \n1: Eve  \n2: Dan  \n3: Amy  \n4: Joe (only one left for this spot)  \n5: Ana  \n6: Ada  \n7: Mel  \n\nStep 3 – Check the options  \nOption B says: Dan finished second.

The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.\n\nIn a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Joe, Dan, Ada, Amy, Rob, Mya, and Mel. Ada finished below Amy. Joe finished below Dan. Dan finished below Ada. Mel finished third-to-last. Amy finished third. Rob finished below Mya.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is true?\nOptions:\nA) Joe finished first.\nB) Dan finished first.\nC) Ada finished first.\nD) Amy finished first.\nE) Rob finished first.\nF) Mya finished first.\nG) Mel finished first.\nReasoning:\nLet’s break this down step by step.  \n\nFacts given:\n\n1. Ada finished below Amy → Amy is above Ada in ranking (lower rank number = better finish).  \n2. Joe finished below Dan → Dan above Joe.  \n3. Dan finished below Ada → Ada above Dan.  \n4. Mel finished third-to-last → 7 golfers, so 3rd-to-last means 5th place. (Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7; 5th is 3rd from last.)  \n5. Amy finished third → Amy is 3rd place.  \n6. Rob finished below Mya → Mya above Rob.\n\nOrder constraints from 1–3:  \nAmy > Ada > Dan > Joe.  \nSo: Amy (3rd) is fixed. Ada must be below Amy, so Ada is 4th or worse. But Ada must be above Dan, who is above Joe.  \n\nAlso: Amy = 3rd. Ada cannot be 3rd, so Ada is 4th or lower.  \n\nCheck Amy = 3rd, Mel = 5th.  \n\nPossible positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.  \nFixed: 3 = Amy, 5 = Mel.  \n\nAmy > Ada > Dan > Joe means:  \nAda must be after 3rd → so Ada = 4th or worse. But if Ada = 4th, then Dan = 5th or worse. But 5th is Mel, so Dan cannot be 5th. So Dan = 6th or 7th if Ada = 4th? Wait, that’s wrong — let’s check carefully.  \n\nActually: Ada > Dan > Joe.  \n\nIf Amy = 3rd, Ada must be 4th or higher number (i.e., lower position) → Ada = 4, 5, 6, or 7.  \nBut Ada > Dan > Joe means Ada’s position number < Dan’s position number < Joe’s position number (since \"finished below\" means higher position number).  \n\nSo: Amy (3) — Ada (?) — Dan (?) — Joe (?).  \n\nAlso Mel = 5th.  \n\nSo possible for Ada = 4th?  \nIf Ada = 4th, then Dan = 6th or 7th (since 5th is Mel). But Dan > Joe, so Joe = 7th if Dan = 6th. That’s possible:  \nPositions: 1, 2, 3=Amy, 4=Ada, 5=Mel, 6=Dan, 7=Joe.  \n\nCheck Rob below Mya: Mya and Rob fill positions 1 and 2 in some order? No — positions left: 1, 2, (3 taken), (4 taken), (5 taken), (6 taken), (7 taken). That leaves 1 and 2 for Mya and Rob. But Rob below Mya → Mya = 1, Rob = 2. Works.  \n\nSo:  \n1: Mya  \n2: Rob  \n3: Amy  \n4: Ada  \n5: Mel  \n6: Dan  \n7: Joe  \n\nCheck all conditions:  \n• Ada below Amy: Amy 3, Ada 4 ✓  \n\n• Joe below Dan: Dan 6, Joe 7 ✓  \n\n• Dan below Ada: Ada 4, Dan 6 ✓  \n\n• Mel 5 ✓  \n\n• Amy 3 ✓  \n\n• Rob below Mya: Mya 1, Rob 2 ✓  \n\nEverything consistent.  \n\nWho is first? Mya.  \n\nLooking at options:  \nF) Mya finished first.  \n\nThe correct option is: F\nAnswer:\nF\n\n"}

Joe finished above Dan → Joe’s position number is smaller than Dan’s.  \n\nSo:  \n• Joe is above Dan.  \n\n• Dan is above Amy.  \n\n• Amy is above Eve? Not necessarily — but Eve is last, so Amy must be above Eve unless Amy is 4th and Eve 5th.  \n\nLet’s try ordering:  \n\nPositions: 1 = Mel, 5 = Eve.  \n\nJoe > Dan > Amy in terms of position numbers (smaller is better).  \nSo possible positions:  \n• Joe could be 2, Dan 3, Amy 4.  \n\n• Check: Joe (2) > Dan (3) > Amy (4) > Eve (5) — yes, works.  \n\n• Could Joe be 1? No, Mel is 1.  \n\nSo: 1: Mel, 2: Joe, 3: Dan, 4: Amy, 5: Eve.  \n\nThus Eve finished last.  \n\nThe correct option is: E\nAnswer:\nE\n\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.

Eve finished first.  \n   Order so far: 1st: Eve, then 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th unknown.\n\n2. Rob finished above Mya.  \n   Rob > Mya in ranking (lower number = better finish).\n\n3.

Now fit Eve (1st) into the partial order Rob > Mya > Joe > Eli.  \n   Rob cannot be 1st because Eve is 1st, so Rob must be 2nd or later, but Rob must be above Mya, Mya above Joe, Joe above Eli.  \n   Let’s test possible positions:  \n   • If Rob is 2nd, then Mya is after Rob (3rd, 4th, or 5th), but Mya must be above Joe, Joe above Eli.  \n\n     So possible: Rob (2nd), Mya (3rd), Joe (4th), Eli (5th).  \n   • Check: Eve (1st), Rob (2nd), Mya (3rd), Joe (4th), Eli (5th).  \n\n     All conditions satisfied:  \n     Rob > Mya ✓, Joe > Eli ✓, Joe below Mya ✓, Eve 1st ✓.  \n\n6. Who is last?  \n   In this arrangement, Eli is last.  \n\nSo the true statement: Eli finished last.  \n\nThe correct option is: B\nAnswer:\nB\n\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.

Amy finished third:  \n   Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 → Amy is 3rd.\n\n2. Ana finished second-to-last:  \n   Second-to-last means 4th place (since there are 5 golfers). So Ana is 4th.\n\n3. Dan finished above Eve: Dan < Eve in ranking? No — \"finished above\" means better position → smaller position number. So Dan’s position number < Eve’s position number.\n\n4. Dan finished below Mya: Mya’s position number < Dan’s position number.\n\nFrom 3 and 4:  \nMya < Dan < Eve in position numbers (smaller number = higher finish).\n\nSo Mya, Dan, Eve are in that order in the ranking (not necessarily consecutive, but Mya before Dan before Eve).\n\nPossible positions:  \nWe know: Amy = 3, Ana = 4.  \nSo remaining positions: 1, 2, 5.\n\nMya, Dan, Eve must occupy three positions in that order: Mya first, then Dan, then Eve.\n\nThe only way Mya < Dan < Eve works with positions {1, 2, 5} is:  \nMya = 1, Dan = 2, Eve = 5.\n\nCheck:  \n1: Mya  \n2: Dan  \n3: Amy  \n4: Ana  \n5: Eve  \n\nThis satisfies all: Dan above Eve (2 < 5), Dan below Mya (2 > 1? Wait — \"Dan finished below Mya\" means worse position than Mya → Dan’s position number > Mya’s. Yes, 2 > 1, so Dan below Mya is satisfied.)  \nAmy 3rd, Ana 4th.\n\nSo last place (5th) is Eve.\n\nThe correct option is: C\nAnswer:\nC\n\n"}

Eve finished below Mya → Mya finished above Eve.  \n\nFrom 2 and 4:  \nRob > Mya > Eve.  \n\nFrom 3: Eve > Ana.  \n\nSo: Rob > Mya > Eve > Ana.  \n\nAmy is fixed at position 2.  \n\nLet’s try to fit Rob, Mya, Eve, Ana around Amy’s position 2.  \n\nIf Amy is 2nd, then 1st must be someone else.  \n\nRob is above Mya, Eve, and Ana. Could Rob be 1st?  \nIf Rob is 1st:  \nThen Mya is below Rob, so Mya could be 3rd, 4th, or 5th. But Mya > Eve > Ana.  \nSo Mya can’t be 5th (because then Eve and Ana would be below her but there’d be no room for both below her if she’s last). Let’s check systematically:  \n\nWe have positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  \nPos 2 = Amy.  \n\nRob = pos 1.  \nMya must be below Rob but above Eve.  \nEve must be above Ana.  \n\nPossible arrangement:  \n1: Rob  \n2: Amy  \n3: Mya  \n4: Eve  \n5: Ana  \n\nCheck:  \nMya below Rob? Yes (3 vs 1).  \nAna below Eve? Yes (5 vs 4).  \nAmy second? Yes.  \nEve below Mya? Yes (4 vs 3).  \n\nAll consistent.  \n\nSecond-to-last means 4th place.  \n4th place = Eve.  \n\nSo Eve finished second-to-last.  \n\nThe correct option is: C\nAnswer:\nC\n\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.\n\nIn a golf tournament, there were five golfers: Dan, Amy, Eve, Ana, and Mya. Dan finished above Eve. Dan finished below Mya. Amy finished third. Ana finished second-to-last.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is true?\nOptions:\nA) Dan finished last.\nB) Amy finished last.\nC) Eve finished last.\nD) Ana finished last.\nE) Mya finished last.\nReasoning:\nLet’s reason through the clues.\n\n1. Amy finished third:  \n   Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 → Amy is 3rd.\n\n2. Ana finished second-to-last:  \n   Second-to-last means 4th place (since there are 5 golfers). So Ana is 4th.\n\n3. Dan finished above Eve: Dan < Eve in ranking? No — \"finished above\" means better position → smaller position number. So Dan’s position number < Eve’s position number.\n\n4. Dan finished below Mya: Mya’s position number < Dan’s position number.\n\nFrom 3 and 4:  \nMya < Dan < Eve in position numbers (smaller number = higher finish).\n\nSo Mya, Dan, Eve are in that order in the ranking (not necessarily consecutive, but Mya before Dan before Eve).\n\nPossible positions:  \nWe know: Amy = 3, Ana = 4.  \nSo remaining positions: 1, 2, 5.\n\nMya, Dan, Eve must occupy three positions in that order: Mya first, then Dan, then Eve.\n\nThe only way Mya < Dan < Eve works with positions {1, 2, 5} is:  \nMya = 1, Dan = 2, Eve = 5.\n\nCheck:  \n1: Mya  \n2: Dan  \n3: Amy  \n4: Ana  \n5: Eve  \n\nThis satisfies all: Dan above Eve (2 < 5), Dan below Mya (2 > 1? Wait — \"Dan finished below Mya\" means worse position than Mya → Dan’s position number > Mya’s. Yes, 2 > 1, so Dan below Mya is satisfied.)  \nAmy 3rd, Ana 4th.\n\nSo last place (5th) is Eve.\n\nThe correct option is: C\nAnswer:\nC\n\n"}

Joe finished below Dan. Dan finished below Ada. Mel finished third-to-last. Amy finished third. Rob finished below Mya.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is true?\nOptions:\nA) Joe finished first.\nB) Dan finished first.\nC) Ada finished first.\nD) Amy finished first.\nE) Rob finished first.\nF) Mya finished first.\nG) Mel finished first.\nReasoning:\nLet’s break this down step by step.  \n\nFacts given:\n\n1. Ada finished below Amy → Amy is above Ada in ranking (lower rank number = better finish).  \n2. Joe finished below Dan → Dan above Joe.  \n3. Dan finished below Ada → Ada above Dan.  \n4. Mel finished third-to-last → 7 golfers, so 3rd-to-last means 5th place. (Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7; 5th is 3rd from last.)  \n5. Amy finished third → Amy is 3rd place.  \n6. Rob finished below Mya → Mya above Rob.\n\nOrder constraints from 1–3:  \nAmy > Ada > Dan > Joe.  \nSo: Amy (3rd) is fixed. Ada must be below Amy, so Ada is 4th or worse. But Ada must be above Dan, who is above Joe.  \n\nAlso: Amy = 3rd. Ada cannot be 3rd, so Ada is 4th or lower.  \n\nCheck Amy = 3rd, Mel = 5th.  \n\nPossible positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.  \nFixed: 3 = Amy, 5 = Mel.  \n\nAmy > Ada > Dan > Joe means:  \nAda must be after 3rd → so Ada = 4th or worse. But if Ada = 4th, then Dan = 5th or worse. But 5th is Mel, so Dan cannot be 5th. So Dan = 6th or 7th if Ada = 4th? Wait, that’s wrong — let’s check carefully.  \n\nActually: Ada > Dan > Joe.  \n\nIf Amy = 3rd, Ada must be 4th or higher number (i.e., lower position) → Ada = 4, 5, 6, or 7.  \nBut Ada > Dan > Joe means Ada’s position number < Dan’s position number < Joe’s position number (since \"finished below\" means higher position number).  \n\nSo: Amy (3) — Ada (?) — Dan (?) — Joe (?).  \n\nAlso Mel = 5th.  \n\nSo possible for Ada = 4th?  \nIf Ada = 4th, then Dan = 6th or 7th (since 5th is Mel). But Dan > Joe, so Joe = 7th if Dan = 6th. That’s possible:  \nPositions: 1, 2, 3=Amy, 4=Ada, 5=Mel, 6=Dan, 7=Joe.  \n\nCheck Rob below Mya: Mya and Rob fill positions 1 and 2 in some order? No — positions left: 1, 2, (3 taken), (4 taken), (5 taken), (6 taken), (7 taken). That leaves 1 and 2 for Mya and Rob. But Rob below Mya → Mya = 1, Rob = 2. Works.  \n\nSo:  \n1: Mya  \n2: Rob  \n3: Amy  \n4: Ada  \n5: Mel  \n6: Dan  \n7: Joe  \n\nCheck all conditions:  \n• Ada below Amy: Amy 3, Ada 4 ✓  \n\n• Joe below Dan: Dan 6, Joe 7 ✓  \n\n• Dan below Ada: Ada 4, Dan 6 ✓  \n\n• Mel 5 ✓  \n\n• Amy 3 ✓  \n\n• Rob below Mya: Mya 1, Rob 2 ✓  \n\nEverything consistent.  \n\nWho is first? Mya.  \n\nLooking at options:  \nF) Mya finished first.  \n\nThe correct option is: F\nAnswer:\nF\n\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.\n\nIn a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Joe, Dan, Ada, Amy, Rob, Mya, and Mel. Ada finished below Amy. Joe finished below Dan. Dan finished below Ada. Mel finished third-to-last. Amy finished third. Rob finished below Mya.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is true?\nOptions:\nA) Joe finished second.\nB) Dan finished second.\nC) Ada finished second.\nD) Amy finished second.\nE) Rob finished second.\nF) Mya finished second.\nG) Mel finished second.\nReasoning:\nLet’s break this down step by step.  \n\n1. List the golfers and facts  \nGolfers: Joe, Dan, Ada, Amy, Rob, Mya, Mel.  \nPositions: 1st (highest) to 7th (lowest).  \n\nFacts:  \n1. Ada finished below Amy → Amy > Ada (in ranking: higher finish = smaller position number).  \n2. Joe finished below Dan → Dan > Joe.  \n3. Dan finished below Ada → Ada > Dan.  \n4. Mel finished third-to-last → 7 total, so 3rd-to-last = 5th place. So Mel is 5th.  \n5. Amy finished 3rd → Amy is 3rd.  \n6. Rob finished below Mya → Mya > Rob.  \n\n2. Combine ordering constraints  \nFrom (1), (3), (2):  \nAmy > Ada > Dan > Joe.  \n\nSo: Amy (3rd) > Ada > Dan > Joe.  \nThat means Ada must be after 3rd, so Ada is 4th, 5th, 6th, or 7th. But 5th is taken by Mel. So Ada could be 4th, 6th, or 7th.  \n\nBut Amy is 3rd, Ada is below Amy, so Ada’s position > 3.  \n\nAlso: Amy (3rd) > Ada > Dan > Joe.  \nSo Ada, Dan, Joe are all below 3rd.  \n\n3. Place Mel  \nMel is 5th. Could Ada be 5th? No, because 5th is Mel. So Ada ≠ 5th.  \n\nSo Ada is either 4th, 6th, or 7th.  \n\nBut if Ada were 6th or 7th, then Dan would be below Ada, so Dan 7th or something, but then Joe below Dan — possible but let’s check constraints with Mya and Rob.  \n\n4. Mya and Rob constraint  \nMya > Rob.  \n\nAlso, all 7 positions must be filled: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.  \n\nWe know:  \nPositions: 3rd = Amy, 5th = Mel.  \n\nRemaining positions: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7.  \n\nPeople not yet placed: Joe, Dan, Ada, Mya, Rob.  \n\nBut Ada > Dan > Joe. So Ada, Dan, Joe must occupy 3 distinct positions all below Amy (3rd), except Amy is 3rd, so they are in {4,6,7} or {4,6,7} with 5 taken by Mel.  \n\nActually, Dan and Joe are below Ada, so Ada must be above Dan and Joe.  \n\nSo possible arrangement:  \n\nCase: Ada in 4th → Then Dan and Joe in {6,7} in order Dan > Joe, so Dan 6th, Joe 7th.  \n\nThen remaining positions {1,2} for Mya and Rob, with Mya > Rob. So Mya 1st, Rob 2nd.  \n\nCheck:  \n1: Mya, 2: Rob, 3: Amy, 4: Ada, 5: Mel, 6: Dan, 7: Joe.  \n\nCheck constraints:  \nAmy (3) > Ada (4) ✅  \nAda (4) > Dan (6) ✅  \nDan (6) > Joe (7) ✅  \nMel 5th ✅  \nAmy 3rd ✅  \nMya (1) > Rob (2) ✅  \n\nAll consistent.  \n\n5. Who is 2nd?  \nFrom above, 2nd = Rob.  \n\nOptions:  \nA) Joe 2nd ❌  \nB) Dan 2nd ❌  \nC) Ada 2nd ❌  \nD) Amy 2nd ❌ (Amy 3rd)  \nE) Rob 2nd ✅  \nF) Mya 2nd ❌ (Mya 1st)  \nG) Mel 2nd ❌ (Mel 5th)  \n\nThe correct option is: E\nAnswer:\nE\n\n"}

Mel finished second-to-last. Rob finished above Eve. Mel finished above Eli. Rob finished below Ada. Eve finished fourth.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is true?\nOptions:\nA) Joe finished last.\nB) Eli finished last.\nC) Ada finished last.\nD) Mel finished last.\nE) Eve finished last.\nF) Rob finished last.\nG) Ana finished last.\nReasoning:\nLet’s break it down step by step.  \n\nKnown facts:  \n1. There are 7 golfers: Joe, Eli, Ada, Mel, Eve, Rob, Ana.  \n2. Joe finished first → Position 1: Joe.  \n3. Mel finished second-to-last → Position 6: Mel.  \n4. Rob finished above Eve → Rob < Eve in position numbers (smaller position number = better finish).  \n5. Mel finished above Eli → Mel < Eli → Mel (6) above Eli? Wait, that’s impossible if positions are 1–7, because 6 is worse than 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  \n   • \"Above\" means better position → smaller number.  \n\n   • So Mel (6) above Eli → Eli must be worse than 6 → Eli must be 7.  \n\n   Yes! That’s the key: If Mel is 6th, and Mel finished above Eli, then Eli must be 7th.  \n\n6. Rob finished below Ada → Ada < Rob (smaller position number for Ada).  \n7. Eve finished 4th → Position 4: Eve.  \n\nFrom 5: Eli is 7th.  \n\nFrom 4: Rob above Eve → Rob’s position < 4. So Rob is in {1, 2, 3}. But position 1 is Joe, so Rob is in {2, 3}.  \n\nFrom 6: Ada < Rob → Ada’s position < Rob’s position.  \n• If Rob is 2 → Ada must be 1, but 1 is Joe → impossible.  \n\n• So Rob must be 3 → Ada must be 2.  \n\nSo:  \nPos 1: Joe  \nPos 2: Ada  \nPos 3: Rob  \nPos 4: Eve  \nPos 6: Mel  \nPos 7: Eli  \n\nRemaining position: 5 → must be Ana.  \n\nOrder: 1 Joe, 2 Ada, 3 Rob, 4 Eve, 5 Ana, 6 Mel, 7 Eli.  \n\nLast place = 7th = Eli.  \n\nThe correct option is: B\nAnswer:\nB\n\n"}

Joe finished above Eli. Joe finished below Mya.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is true?\nOptions:\nA) Eve finished last.\nB) Eli finished last.\nC) Joe finished last.\nD) Rob finished last.\nE) Mya finished last.\nReasoning:\nLet’s reason through the conditions step by step.  \n\n1. Eve finished first.  \n   Order so far: 1st: Eve, then 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th unknown.\n\n2. Rob finished above Mya.  \n   Rob > Mya in ranking (lower number = better finish).\n\n3. Joe finished above Eli.  \n   Joe > Eli.\n\n4. Joe finished below Mya.  \n   Mya > Joe.  \n   Combined with Joe > Eli: Mya > Joe > Eli.  \n   Combined with Rob > Mya: Rob > Mya > Joe > Eli.\n\n5. Now fit Eve (1st) into the partial order Rob > Mya > Joe > Eli.  \n   Rob cannot be 1st because Eve is 1st, so Rob must be 2nd or later, but Rob must be above Mya, Mya above Joe, Joe above Eli.  \n   Let’s test possible positions:  \n   • If Rob is 2nd, then Mya is after Rob (3rd, 4th, or 5th), but Mya must be above Joe, Joe above Eli.  \n\n     So possible: Rob (2nd), Mya (3rd), Joe (4th), Eli (5th).  \n   • Check: Eve (1st), Rob (2nd), Mya (3rd), Joe (4th), Eli (5th).  \n\n     All conditions satisfied:  \n     Rob > Mya ✓, Joe > Eli ✓, Joe below Mya ✓, Eve 1st ✓.  \n\n6. Who is last?  \n   In this arrangement, Eli is last.  \n\nSo the true statement: Eli finished last.  \n\nThe correct option is: B\nAnswer:\nB\n\n"}

Let’s check:  \n\nPositions filled: 1=M, 2=Pc, 4=L, 7=Pl.  \nPositions open: 3, 5, 6.  \n\nBut we have 3 fruits left: A, Pe, K. That’s only 3 fruits for 3 spots. Good.\n\nWe know A > Pe > K.  \nSo possible assignments of {3,5,6} to A, Pe, K respecting A < Pe < K in rank numbers? Wait — careful: \"more expensive\" means rank number is smaller.  \n\nA > Pe means rank#(A) < rank#(Pe).  \nPe > K means rank#(Pe) < rank#(K).  \n\nSo in order of expensiveness: A most expensive of the three, then Pe, then K least expensive of the three.  \n\nSo among positions 3,5,6 (where 3 is most expensive of these three spots, 6 is cheapest of these three spots), we must have:  \nA in 3, Pe in 5, K in 6.  \nThat fits: 3(A) > 5(Pe) > 6(K) in expensiveness.\n\nSo final order:  \n1: Mangoes  \n2: Peaches  \n3: Apples  \n4: Loquats  \n5: Pears  \n6: Kiwis  \n7: Plums  \n\nCheapest = Plums (position 7).  \n\nLooking at the options:  \nF) The plums are the cheapest.  \n\nThe correct option is: F\nAnswer:\nF\n\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.\n\nA fruit stand sells seven fruits: cantaloupes, plums, mangoes, apples, loquats, pears, and peaches. The apples are less expensive than the cantaloupes. The apples are more expensive than the peaches. The mangoes are the fourth-most expensive. The peaches are more expensive than the plums. The pears are the third-most expensive. The loquats are the third-cheapest.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is true?\nOptions:\nA) The cantaloupes are the second-most expensive.\nB) The plums are the second-most expensive.\nC) The mangoes are the second-most expensive.\nD) The apples are the second-most expensive.\nE) The loquats are the second-most expensive.\nF) The pears are the second-most expensive.\nG) The peaches are the second-most expensive.\nReasoning:\nLet’s go step by step.  \n\nWe have 7 fruits:  \nCantaloupes (C), Plums (P), Mangoes (M), Apples (A), Loquats (L), Pears (Pe), Peaches (Ps).  \nFrom most expensive (1st) to cheapest (7th).  \n\nGiven facts:\n\n1. Apples are less expensive than cantaloupes:  \n   C > A  (Cantaloupes more expensive than Apples).\n\n2. Apples are more expensive than peaches:  \n   A > Ps.\n\n3. Mangoes are the 4th-most expensive:  \n   M = 4.\n\n4. Peaches are more expensive than plums:  \n   Ps > P.\n\n5. Pears are the 3rd-most expensive:  \n   Pe = 3.\n\n6. Loquats are the 3rd-cheapest:  \n   Loquats = 5th (because 3rd-cheapest means 5th in order from most expensive to least: ranks 1–7, cheapest is rank 7, 2nd-cheapest is rank 6, 3rd-cheapest is rank 5).  \n   So L = 5.\n\nStep 1 – Fill known ranks:  \nRank 3: Pe  \nRank 4: M  \nRank 5: L  \n\nRemaining ranks: 1, 2, 6, 7 for fruits C, A, Ps, P.\n\nStep 2 – Use inequalities:  \nFrom C > A > Ps > P:  \nOrder among these four: C most expensive of the four, then A, then Ps, then P cheapest of the four.\n\nSo in the remaining set {C, A, Ps, P}, the order is:  \nC > A > Ps > P.\n\nStep 3 – Assign ranks 1, 2, 6, 7 to C, A, Ps, P in that order:  \nC must be rank 1 or 2 (since C > A and ranks left are 1, 2, 6, 7; if C were rank 6 or 7, impossible because A would be even lower, but A must be higher than Ps and P).  \nActually check: Ranks left: 1, 2, 6, 7.  \nC > A > Ps > P.  \nSo highest rank (smallest number = most expensive) goes to C, then A, then Ps, then P.  \nThus:  \nC = rank 1 or 2? Wait, but ranks available are 1, 2, 6, 7.  \nIf C = rank 1, then A = rank 2 (since A is next in order and ranks 6,7 are lower than 2, so A can’t be 6 or 7 if Ps and P are below A).  \nThen Ps = rank 6, P = rank 7.  \nThat fits: C=1, A=2, Ps=6, P=7.  \n\nIf C = rank 2, then A would have to be rank 6 or 7? No, that’s impossible because A > Ps > P, so A must be higher rank (smaller number) than Ps and P.  \nBut if C=2, then available ranks for A are {6,7} if 1 is taken by something else? But rank 1 is not taken by C in that case, so who is rank 1?  \nWe must check: Ranks 3,4,5 are taken by Pe, M, L. So rank 1 and 2 are open for C and maybe A.  \nIf C=2, then rank 1 must be one of the fruits that are not C, A, Ps, P — but fruits not in {C, A, Ps, P} are Pe, M, L, whose ranks are fixed at 3,4,5. So rank 1 must be one of C, A, Ps, P. But C is the most expensive of all fruits? Not necessarily, but is it possible something outside this set is rank 1? No — all fruits are in that set or in {Pe, M, L}. So possible rank 1 fruits: C, A, Ps, P, or Pe, M, L. But Pe=3, M=4, L=5, so they can’t be rank 1. So rank 1 must be C, A, Ps, or P. But C > A > Ps > P, so only C can be rank 1.  \nThus C = 1 necessarily.  \n\nSo C = 1.  \n\nThen A = 2 (since A is next in the chain and ranks left for {A, Ps, P} are 2, 6, 7; A must be the highest of these three, so A=2).  \nThen Ps = 6, P = 7.  \n\nStep 4 – Check full order:  \n1: C  \n2: A  \n3: Pe  \n4: M  \n5: L  \n6: Ps  \n7: P  \n\nAll conditions satisfied:  \nC > A ✓ (1>2)  \nA > Ps ✓ (2>6)  \nM=4 ✓  \nPs > P ✓ (6>7)  \nPe=3 ✓  \nL=5 ✓  \n\nStep 5 – Answer the question:  \nSecond-most expensive = rank 2 = Apples.  \n\nThe correct option is: D\nAnswer:\nD\n\n"}

The mangoes are more expensive than the watermelons. The kiwis are less expensive than the apples. The kiwis are more expensive than the mangoes.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is true?\nOptions:\nA) The watermelons are the cheapest.\nB) The apples are the cheapest.\nC) The kiwis are the cheapest.\nD) The cantaloupes are the cheapest.\nE) The mangoes are the cheapest.\nReasoning:\nLet’s break this down step by step.  \n\nWe have 5 fruits: W (watermelons), A (apples), K (kiwis), C (cantaloupes), M (mangoes).  \nPrice ordering from cheapest (1) to most expensive (5).  \n\n1. \"Cantaloupes are the second-cheapest\" → C is in position 2.  \n\n2. \"Mangoes are more expensive than watermelons\" → M > W.  \n\n3. \"Kiwis are less expensive than apples\" → K < A.  \n\n4. \"Kiwis are more expensive than mangoes\" → K > M.  \n\nFrom 2 and 4: K > M > W.  \nFrom 3: K < A, so A > K > M > W.  \n\nSo far: A > K > M > W.  \n\nCantaloupe (C) is 2nd cheapest.  \nPossible positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (cheapest to most expensive).  \nC = position 2.  \n\nWhere can W, M, K, A fit?  \n\nWe have A > K > M > W.  \nThat’s 4 fruits in descending price order.  \nC must be inserted into this ordering.  \n\nTry: C is 2nd cheapest, so only one fruit is cheaper than C.  \nWho could be cheaper than C?  \nFrom A > K > M > W, the cheapest of them is W.  \nSo W must be cheaper than C (because if W were more expensive than C, then M, K, A would all be more expensive than C, making C the cheapest, but C is 2nd cheapest, so exactly one is cheaper).  \n\nThus: W is cheaper than C.  \n\nSo W is in position 1, C in position 2.  \n\nNow: A > K > M > W.  \nWe know W is 1, C is 2.  \nWhere do M, K, A go? They are all more expensive than C (since M > W and C > W, but is M > C? Let’s check: M > W, C > W, but we don’t know M vs C yet from given, but from K > M and K < A, and C fixed at 2, let’s see ordering).  \n\nWe have positions: 1: W, 2: C.  \nRemaining positions 3, 4, 5 for M, K, A.  \n\nBut A > K > M. So the only ordering for those three is A (5), K (4), M (3).  \n\nSo: 1: W, 2: C, 3: M, 4: K, 5: A.  \n\nCheck conditions:  \n• C is 2nd cheapest: yes.  \n\n• M > W: M is 3, W is 1 → yes.  \n\n• K < A: K is 4, A is 5 → yes.  \n\n• K > M: K is 4, M is 3 → yes.  \n\nAll consistent.  \n\nThus, the cheapest is W.  \n\nThe correct option is: A\nAnswer:\nA\n\n"}

Minivan is older than sedan → Minivan comes before Sedan in age order (older = lower rank in 1=oldest, 5=newest).  \n2. Tractor is older than hatchback → Tractor comes before Hatchback.  \n3. Minivan is the third-newest → That means Minivan is 3rd from oldest? No — \"third-newest\" means:  \n   • Newest = 5th,  \n\n   • Second-newest = 4th,  \n\n   • Third-newest = 3rd in age order? Wait, careful:  \n\n   If we number 1=oldest, 5=newest, then:  \n   • 5th = newest  \n\n   • 4th = second-newest  \n\n   • 3rd = third-newest  \n\n   So Minivan is 3rd in the age order (1=oldest to 5=newest).  \n\n4.

We have five vehicles: tractor (T), station wagon (SW), minivan (MV), sedan (S), hatchback (H).  \n2. Age order: older = smaller number in ranking if 1 = oldest, 5 = newest.  \n4. Given:  \n   • MV is older than S → MV < S in age rank (smaller rank number = older).  \n\n   • T is older than H → T < H.  \n\n   • MV is the third-newest → MV is 3rd from oldest? Wait, careful: \"third-newest\" means:  \n\n     Newest = 5th, 2nd-newest = 4th, 3rd-newest = 3rd (in age rank: 1=oldest, 5=newest).  \n     So MV is rank 3 in age (so 3rd from oldest = 3rd oldest).  \n   • SW is the second-newest → SW is rank 4 in age.  \n\n5. Assign known ranks:  \n   Rank 3 = MV  \n   Rank 4 = SW  \n\n6. Remaining ranks: 1, 2, 5 are for T, S, H.  \n\n7. MV (3) is older than S → S must be newer than MV, so S must be rank 4 or 5. But rank 4 is SW, so S must be rank 5.  \n   So: S = rank 5 (newest).  \n\n8. T is older than H → T < H in rank number (age rank).

Minivan is older than sedan → Minivan comes before Sedan in age order (older = lower rank in 1=oldest, 5=newest).  \n2. Tractor is older than hatchback → Tractor comes before Hatchback.  \n3. Minivan is the third-newest → That means Minivan is 3rd from oldest? No — \"third-newest\" means:  \n   • Newest = 5th,  \n\n   • Second-newest = 4th,  \n\n   • Third-newest = 3rd in age order? Wait, careful:  \n\n   If we number 1=oldest, 5=newest, then:  \n   • 5th = newest  \n\n   • 4th = second-newest  \n\n   • 3rd = third-newest  \n\n   So Minivan is 3rd in the age order (1=oldest to 5=newest).  \n\n4.

(newest)  \n\nFrom fact 1: Minivan (3) is older than Sedan → Sedan must be newer than 3 → Sedan is either 4 or 5. But 4 is Station wagon, so Sedan must be 5.  \n\nSo:  \n5 = Sedan (newest)  \n4 = Station wagon  \n3 = Minivan  \n\nRemaining positions: 1 and 2 for Tractor and Hatchback.  \n\nFrom fact 2: Tractor is older than Hatchback → Tractor must be 1, Hatchback 2.  \n\nSo final order oldest to newest:  \n1: Tractor  \n2: Hatchback  \n3: Minivan  \n4: Station wagon  \n5: Sedan  \n\nThe question asks: Which of the following is true?  \nOptions:  \nA) Tractor is third-newest → No, Tractor is oldest.  \nB) Station wagon is third-newest → No, it’s second-newest.  \nC) Minivan is third-newest → Yes, that’s given and fits.  \nD) Sedan is third-newest → No, it’s newest.  \nE) Hatchback is third-newest → No, it’s second-oldest.  \n\nSo the true statement is C.  \n\nThe correct option is: C\nAnswer:\nC\n\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.

Eve finished below Mya → Mya finished above Eve.  \n\nFrom 2 and 4:  \nRob > Mya > Eve.  \n\nFrom 3: Eve > Ana.  \n\nSo: Rob > Mya > Eve > Ana.  \n\nAmy is fixed at position 2.  \n\nLet’s try to fit Rob, Mya, Eve, Ana around Amy’s position 2.  \n\nIf Amy is 2nd, then 1st must be someone else.  \n\nRob is above Mya, Eve, and Ana. Could Rob be 1st?  \nIf Rob is 1st:  \nThen Mya is below Rob, so Mya could be 3rd, 4th, or 5th. But Mya > Eve > Ana.  \nSo Mya can’t be 5th (because then Eve and Ana would be below her but there’d be no room for both below her if she’s last). Let’s check systematically:  \n\nWe have positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  \nPos 2 = Amy.  \n\nRob = pos 1.  \nMya must be below Rob but above Eve.  \nEve must be above Ana.  \n\nPossible arrangement:  \n1: Rob  \n2: Amy  \n3: Mya  \n4: Eve  \n5: Ana  \n\nCheck:  \nMya below Rob? Yes (3 vs 1).  \nAna below Eve? Yes (5 vs 4).  \nAmy second? Yes.  \nEve below Mya? Yes (4 vs 3).  \n\nAll consistent.  \n\nSecond-to-last means 4th place.  \n4th place = Eve.  \n\nSo Eve finished second-to-last.  \n\nThe correct option is: C\nAnswer:\nC\n\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.\n\nIn a golf tournament, there were five golfers: Mel, Dan, Amy, Joe, and Eve. Amy finished below Dan. Mel finished first. Joe finished above Dan. Eve finished last.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is true?\nOptions:\nA) Mel finished last.\nB) Dan finished last.\nC) Amy finished last.\nD) Joe finished last.\nE) Eve finished last.\nReasoning:\nLet’s reason it out step by step.  \n\n1. Fixed order of 5 golfers: Mel, Dan, Amy, Joe, Eve.  \n2. Mel finished first → Mel is in position 1.  \n3. Eve finished last → Eve is in position 5.  \n4. Amy finished below Dan → Dan’s position number is smaller than Amy’s (lower number = better finish).  \n5. Joe finished above Dan → Joe’s position number is smaller than Dan’s.  \n\nSo:  \n• Joe is above Dan.  \n\n• Dan is above Amy.  \n\n• Amy is above Eve? Not necessarily — but Eve is last, so Amy must be above Eve unless Amy is 4th and Eve 5th.  \n\nLet’s try ordering:  \n\nPositions: 1 = Mel, 5 = Eve.  \n\nJoe > Dan > Amy in terms of position numbers (smaller is better).  \nSo possible positions:  \n• Joe could be 2, Dan 3, Amy 4.  \n\n• Check: Joe (2) > Dan (3) > Amy (4) > Eve (5) — yes, works.  \n\n• Could Joe be 1? No, Mel is 1.  \n\nSo: 1: Mel, 2: Joe, 3: Dan, 4: Amy, 5: Eve.  \n\nThus Eve finished last.  \n\nThe correct option is: E\nAnswer:\nE\n\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.\n\nIn a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Joe, Dan, Ana, Mel, Ada, Eve, and Amy. Eve finished above Amy. Dan finished second. Ada finished below Ana. Ana finished third-to-last. Mel finished last. Amy finished third.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is true?\nOptions:\nA) Joe finished second.\nB) Dan finished second.\nC) Ana finished second.\nD) Mel finished second.\nE) Ada finished second.\nF) Eve finished second.\nG) Amy finished second.\nReasoning:\nLet’s break this down step by step.  \n\nStep 1 – Known fixed positions  \n• Dan finished second. (Given explicitly.)  \n\n• Amy finished third. (Given.)  \n\n• Mel finished last (7th).  \n\n• Ana finished third-to-last (i.e., 5th place out of 7).  \n\nSo far:  \n1: ?  \n2: Dan  \n3: Amy  \n4: ?  \n5: Ana  \n6: ?  \n7: Mel  \n\nStep 2 – Other constraints  \n• Eve finished above Amy → Eve must be in position 1 or 2, but 2 is Dan, so Eve must be 1st.  \n\nNow:  \n1: Eve  \n2: Dan  \n3: Amy  \n4: ?  \n5: Ana  \n6: ?  \n7: Mel  \n\n• Ada finished below Ana → Ana is 5th, so Ada must be 6th (since 7th is Mel).  \n\nNow:  \n1: Eve  \n2: Dan  \n3: Amy  \n4: Joe (only one left for this spot)  \n5: Ana  \n6: Ada  \n7: Mel  \n\nStep 3 – Check the options  \nOption B says: Dan finished second. This matches our table.  \n\nStep 4 – Verify no contradictions  \nAll conditions satisfied:  \n• Eve above Amy ✓ (1 vs 3)  \n\n• Dan 2nd ✓  \n\n• Ada below Ana ✓ (6 vs 5)  \n\n• Ana 5th (third-to-last) ✓  \n\n• Mel last ✓  \n\n• Amy 3rd ✓  \n\nStep 5 – Conclusion  \nThe correct option is B.  \n\nThe correct option is: B\nAnswer:\nB\n\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.

The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.\n\nOn a branch, there are seven birds: a hawk, a raven, a falcon, a crow, a hummingbird, a robin, and a cardinal. The hawk is the second from the right. The robin is to the left of the raven. The raven is to the left of the crow. The falcon is to the left of the cardinal. The hummingbird is the second from the left. The falcon is the third from the right.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is true?\nOptions:\nA) The hawk is the second from the right.\nB) The raven is the second from the right.\nC) The falcon is the second from the right.\nD) The crow is the second from the right.\nE) The hummingbird is the second from the right.\nF) The robin is the second from the right.\nG) The cardinal is the second from the right.\nReasoning:\nLet’s go step by step.  \n\nWe have 7 positions: 1 (leftmost) to 7 (rightmost).  \n\n1. \"The hawk is the second from the right.\"  \n   → Hawk is at position 6.  \n\n2. \"The hummingbird is the second from the left.\"  \n   → Hummingbird is at position 2.  \n\n3. \"The falcon is the third from the right.\"  \n   → Falcon is at position 5.  \n\n4. \"The robin is to the left of the raven.\"  \n   → Robin < Raven (in position number).  \n\n5. \"The raven is to the left of the crow.\"  \n   → Raven < Crow.  \n\n6. \"The falcon is to the left of the cardinal.\"  \n   → Falcon (position 5) < Cardinal → Cardinal must be in position 6 or 7, but position 6 is Hawk, so Cardinal must be in position 7.  \n\nSo far:  \nPos 1: ?  \nPos 2: Hummingbird  \nPos 3: ?  \nPos 4: ?  \nPos 5: Falcon  \nPos 6: Hawk  \nPos 7: Cardinal  \n\nRemaining birds: Raven, Crow, Robin.  \n\nFrom Robin < Raven < Crow:  \nPos 3 = Robin, Pos 4 = Raven, Crow must be at position 1 (only spot left for Crow? Wait, check: positions left: 1, 3, 4. But Crow must be right of Raven, so Raven at 4 → Crow at ? but 5,6,7 are taken. That’s impossible. So something’s wrong.  \n\nLet’s check:  \nPositions available: 1, 3, 4.  \nRaven < Crow, so Crow must be after Raven. If Raven is in 3 or 4, Crow must be in a higher position than Raven, but 5,6,7 are Falcon, Hawk, Cardinal — none are Crow. So Crow can’t be placed.  \n\nSo maybe I made a wrong assignment earlier. Let’s re-check constraints.  \n\nWe have:  \n• Hummingbird = 2.  \n\n• Hawk = 6.  \n\n• Falcon = 5.  \n\n• Falcon < Cardinal → Cardinal = 6 or 7. But 6 is Hawk, so Cardinal = 7.  \n\nSo positions:  \n1: ?  \n2: Hmb  \n3: ?  \n4: ?  \n5: Fal  \n6: Hawk  \n7: Card  \n\nRemaining birds: Raven, Crow, Robin.  \n\nRobin < Raven < Crow.  \n\nCrow must be after Raven, but after Raven means position > Raven’s.  \nAvailable positions: 1, 3, 4.  \n\nIf Raven is in 4, Crow must be in >4, but 5,6,7 are taken. So impossible.  \nIf Raven is in 3, Crow must be in >3, but 4,5,6,7 available? 4 is available, but 5,6,7 are taken. So Crow could be in 4. That works:  \nRobin < Raven < Crow:  \nRobin in 1, Raven in 3, Crow in 4.  \n\nCheck:  \n1: Robin  \n2: Hummingbird  \n3: Raven  \n4: Crow  \n5: Falcon  \n6: Hawk  \n7: Cardinal  \n\nAll constraints:  \nRobin (1) < Raven (3) ✓  \nRaven (3) < Crow (4) ✓  \nFalcon (5) < Cardinal (7) ✓  \nHawk 6 ✓, Hummingbird 2 ✓, Falcon 5 ✓.  \n\nEverything consistent.  \n\nNow, “second from the right” = position 6 = Hawk.  \n\nThat’s option A.  \n\nThe correct option is: A\nAnswer:\nA\n\n"}

Rob finished above Eve → Rob < Eve in position numbers (smaller position number = better finish).  \n5. Mel finished above Eli → Mel < Eli → Mel (6) above Eli?

Mya  \n2. Eve  \n3. Rob  \n4. Dan  \n5. Joe  \n\nSo Joe is last.  \n\nThe correct option is: A\nAnswer:\nA\n\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.\n\nIn a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Joe, Eli, Ada, Mel, Eve, Rob, and Ana. Joe finished first. Mel finished second-to-last. Rob finished above Eve. Mel finished above Eli. Rob finished below Ada. Eve finished fourth.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is true?\nOptions:\nA) Joe finished last.\nB) Eli finished last.\nC) Ada finished last.\nD) Mel finished last.\nE) Eve finished last.\nF) Rob finished last.\nG) Ana finished last.\nReasoning:\nLet’s break it down step by step.  \n\nKnown facts:  \n1. There are 7 golfers: Joe, Eli, Ada, Mel, Eve, Rob, Ana.  \n2. Joe finished first → Position 1: Joe.  \n3. Mel finished second-to-last → Position 6: Mel.  \n4. Rob finished above Eve → Rob < Eve in position numbers (smaller position number = better finish).  \n5. Mel finished above Eli → Mel < Eli → Mel (6) above Eli? Wait, that’s impossible if positions are 1–7, because 6 is worse than 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  \n   • \"Above\" means better position → smaller number.  \n\n   • So Mel (6) above Eli → Eli must be worse than 6 → Eli must be 7.  \n\n   Yes! That’s the key: If Mel is 6th, and Mel finished above Eli, then Eli must be 7th.  \n\n6. Rob finished below Ada → Ada < Rob (smaller position number for Ada).  \n7. Eve finished 4th → Position 4: Eve.  \n\nFrom 5: Eli is 7th.  \n\nFrom 4: Rob above Eve → Rob’s position < 4. So Rob is in {1, 2, 3}. But position 1 is Joe, so Rob is in {2, 3}.  \n\nFrom 6: Ada < Rob → Ada’s position < Rob’s position.  \n• If Rob is 2 → Ada must be 1, but 1 is Joe → impossible.  \n\n• So Rob must be 3 → Ada must be 2.  \n\nSo:  \nPos 1: Joe  \nPos 2: Ada  \nPos 3: Rob  \nPos 4: Eve  \nPos 6: Mel  \nPos 7: Eli  \n\nRemaining position: 5 → must be Ana.  \n\nOrder: 1 Joe, 2 Ada, 3 Rob, 4 Eve, 5 Ana, 6 Mel, 7 Eli.  \n\nLast place = 7th = Eli.  \n\nThe correct option is: B\nAnswer:\nB\n\n"}

Oranges are the second-most expensive:  O = 4  (since 5 is most expensive, 4 is second-most expensive)  \n4. Mangoes are the second-cheapest:  M = 2  (since 1 is cheapest, 2 is second-cheapest)  \n\nStep 1 – Place M and O in the ranking:  \nRank positions: 1 (cheapest), 2, 3, 4, 5 (most expensive)  \n\nFrom (4):  M = 2   \nFrom (3):  O = 4   \n\nStep 2 – Use  K < M :  \n M = 2 , so  K < 2  ⇒  K = 1  (only possibility, since 1 is the only rank cheaper than 2).  \n\nSo  K = 1 ,  M = 2 .  \n\nStep 3 – Use  P < O :  \n O = 4 , so  P < 4 . Possible ranks for P: 1, 2, or 3.  \n\nBut rank 1 is K, rank 2 is M, so P cannot be 1 or 2 (unless two fruits share a rank, but logically consistent means unique order). So P must be 3.  \n\nThus  P = 3 .  \n\nStep 4 – Remaining fruit C takes the only empty spot:  \nFilled: K=1, M=2, P=3, O=4, so C=5.  \n\nOrder cheapest → most expensive:  \n1: K  \n2: M  \n3: P  \n4: O  \n5: C  \n\nStep 5 – Third-most expensive means rank 3 (since 5 is most expensive, 4 is second-most expensive, 3 is third-most expensive).  \nRank 3 = Peaches.  \n\nSo “Peaches are the third-most expensive” is true.  \n\nThe correct option is: E\nAnswer:\nE\n\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.

Fruits: Cantaloupes (C), Kiwis (K), Oranges (O), Mangoes (M), Peaches (P).  \n   Order from most expensive (1st) to cheapest (5th).\n\n2. \"Oranges are the second-most expensive\" → O is in position 2 (expensive rank 2).\n\n3. \"Mangoes are the second-cheapest\" → M is in position 4 (expensive rank 4 out of 5).\n\n4. \"Kiwis are less expensive than mangoes\" → K is cheaper than M.  \n   M is rank 4, so cheaper fruits are rank 5 only (since rank 1–3 are more expensive than M).  \n   Wait, check: If M is rank 4, then cheaper fruits: only rank 5.  \n   So K must be rank 5 (cheapest).  \n\n5. \"Peaches are less expensive than oranges\" → P cheaper than O.  \n   O is rank 2, so P could be ranks 3, 4, or 5.  \n   But rank 4 is M, rank 5 is K, so P must be rank 3 (since 4 and 5 are taken by M and K).  \n\n6.

Apples are less expensive than cantaloupes:  \n   C > A  (Cantaloupes more expensive than Apples).\n\n2. Apples are more expensive than peaches:  \n   A > Ps.\n\n3. Mangoes are the 4th-most expensive:  \n   M = 4.\n\n4. Peaches are more expensive than plums:  \n   Ps > P.\n\n5. Pears are the 3rd-most expensive:  \n   Pe = 3.\n\n6. Loquats are the 3rd-cheapest:  \n   Loquats = 5th (because 3rd-cheapest means 5th in order from most expensive to least: ranks 1–7, cheapest is rank 7, 2nd-cheapest is rank 6, 3rd-cheapest is rank 5).  \n   So L = 5.\n\nStep 1 – Fill known ranks:  \nRank 3: Pe  \nRank 4: M  \nRank 5: L  \n\nRemaining ranks: 1, 2, 6, 7 for fruits C, A, Ps, P.\n\nStep 2 – Use inequalities:  \nFrom C > A > Ps > P:  \nOrder among these four: C most expensive of the four, then A, then Ps, then P cheapest of the four.\n\nSo in the remaining set {C, A, Ps, P}, the order is:  \nC > A > Ps > P.\n\nStep 3 – Assign ranks 1, 2, 6, 7 to C, A, Ps, P in that order:  \nC must be rank 1 or 2 (since C > A and ranks left are 1, 2, 6, 7; if C were rank 6 or 7, impossible because A would be even lower, but A must be higher than Ps and P).  \nActually check: Ranks left: 1, 2, 6, 7.  \nC > A > Ps > P.  \nSo highest rank (smallest number = most expensive) goes to C, then A, then Ps, then P.  \nThus:  \nC = rank 1 or 2? Wait, but ranks available are 1, 2, 6, 7.  \nIf C = rank 1, then A = rank 2 (since A is next in order and ranks 6,7 are lower than 2, so A can’t be 6 or 7 if Ps and P are below A).  \nThen Ps = rank 6, P = rank 7.  \nThat fits: C=1, A=2, Ps=6, P=7.  \n\nIf C = rank 2, then A would have to be rank 6 or 7? No, that’s impossible because A > Ps > P, so A must be higher rank (smaller number) than Ps and P.  \nBut if C=2, then available ranks for A are {6,7} if 1 is taken by something else? But rank 1 is not taken by C in that case, so who is rank 1?  \nWe must check: Ranks 3,4,5 are taken by Pe, M, L. So rank 1 and 2 are open for C and maybe A.  \nIf C=2, then rank 1 must be one of the fruits that are not C, A, Ps, P — but fruits not in {C, A, Ps, P} are Pe, M, L, whose ranks are fixed at 3,4,5. So rank 1 must be one of C, A, Ps, P. But C is the most expensive of all fruits? Not necessarily, but is it possible something outside this set is rank 1? No — all fruits are in that set or in {Pe, M, L}. So possible rank 1 fruits: C, A, Ps, P, or Pe, M, L. But Pe=3, M=4, L=5, so they can’t be rank 1. So rank 1 must be C, A, Ps, or P. But C > A > Ps > P, so only C can be rank 1.  \nThus C = 1 necessarily.  \n\nSo C = 1.  \n\nThen A = 2 (since A is next in the chain and ranks left for {A, Ps, P} are 2, 6, 7; A must be the highest of these three, so A=2).  \nThen Ps = 6, P = 7.  \n\nStep 4 – Check full order:  \n1: C  \n2: A  \n3: Pe  \n4: M  \n5: L  \n6: Ps  \n7: P  \n\nAll conditions satisfied:  \nC > A ✓ (1>2)  \nA > Ps ✓ (2>6)  \nM=4 ✓  \nPs > P ✓ (6>7)  \nPe=3 ✓  \nL=5 ✓  \n\nStep 5 – Answer the question:  \nSecond-most expensive = rank 2 = Apples.  \n\nThe correct option is: D\nAnswer:\nD\n\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.

Apples < Cantaloupes (in price) → Cantaloupes are more expensive than Apples.  \n   So: Cantaloupes have a better (smaller) rank number than Apples.\n\n2. Apples > Peaches → Apples are more expensive than Peaches.  \n   So: Apples have a better rank than Peaches.\n\n3. Mangoes are the fourth-most expensive → Mangoes rank 4.\n\n4. Peaches > Plums → Peaches are more expensive than Plums.  \n   So: Peaches rank better than Plums.\n\n5. Pears are the third-most expensive → Pears rank 3.\n\n6. Loquats are the third-cheapest →  \n   \"Third-cheapest\" means 3rd from the bottom → rank 5 (since cheapest = rank 7, second-cheapest = rank 6, third-cheapest = rank 5).  \n   So: Loquats rank 5.\n\nKnown ranks so far:  \nRank 3: Pears  \nRank 4: Mangoes  \nRank 5: Loquats  \n\nOrder constraints from price comparisons:\n\nFrom (1) and (2):  \nCantaloupes > Apples > Peaches > Plums.  \nSo order: Cantaloupes (best rank), then Apples, then Peaches, then Plums (worst of these four).\n\nWhere to place Cantaloupes, Apples, Peaches, Plums given fixed ranks 3,4,5 are taken?\n\nRanks available: 1, 2, 6, 7 (since 3 = Pears, 4 = Mangoes, 5 = Loquats).\n\nCantaloupes must be in a better rank than Apples. Apples better than Peaches. Peaches better than Plums.\n\nSo these 4 fruits must occupy 4 distinct ranks from {1,2,6,7} in that order: Cantaloupes, Apples, Peaches, Plums.\n\nBut {1,2,6,7} in descending price order is: 1 (most expensive), 2, then 6, then 7 (cheapest).  \nCheck if that fits the chain Cantaloupes > Apples > Peaches > Plums:  \n• Cantaloupes could be rank 1, Apples rank 2, Peaches rank 6, Plums rank 7.  \n\nYes — ranks 3,4,5 are for Pears, Mangoes, Loquats (already fixed), so that works.\n\nSo final ranking (most expensive to least expensive):\n\n1. Cantaloupes  \n2. Apples  \n3. Pears  \n4. Mangoes  \n5. Loquats  \n6. Peaches  \n7.

Dan finished above Eve: Dan < Eve in ranking? No — \"finished above\" means better position → smaller position number. So Dan’s position number < Eve’s position number.\n\n4. Dan finished below Mya: Mya’s position number < Dan’s position number.\n\nFrom 3 and 4:  \nMya < Dan < Eve in position numbers (smaller number = higher finish).\n\nSo Mya, Dan, Eve are in that order in the ranking (not necessarily consecutive, but Mya before Dan before Eve).\n\nPossible positions:  \nWe know: Amy = 3, Ana = 4.  \nSo remaining positions: 1, 2, 5.\n\nMya, Dan, Eve must occupy three positions in that order: Mya first, then Dan, then Eve.\n\nThe only way Mya < Dan < Eve works with positions {1, 2, 5} is:  \nMya = 1, Dan = 2, Eve = 5.\n\nCheck:  \n1: Mya  \n2: Dan  \n3: Amy  \n4: Ana  \n5: Eve  \n\nThis satisfies all: Dan above Eve (2 < 5), Dan below Mya (2 > 1? Wait — \"Dan finished below Mya\" means worse position than Mya → Dan’s position number > Mya’s. Yes, 2 > 1, so Dan below Mya is satisfied.)  \nAmy 3rd, Ana 4th.\n\nSo last place (5th) is Eve.\n\nThe correct option is: C\nAnswer:\nC\n\n"}

The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.\n\nIn a golf tournament, there were five golfers: Rob, Amy, Eve, Mya, and Ana. Mya finished below Rob. Ana finished below Eve. Amy finished second. Eve finished below Mya.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is true?\nOptions:\nA) Rob finished second-to-last.\nB) Amy finished second-to-last.\nC) Eve finished second-to-last.\nD) Mya finished second-to-last.\nE) Ana finished second-to-last.\nReasoning:\nLet’s reason through the clues step by step.  \n\nWe have 5 golfers: Rob, Amy, Eve, Mya, Ana.  \nPositions: 1st (highest) to 5th (lowest).  \n\n1. Amy finished second → Amy is in position 2.  \n2. Mya finished below Rob → Rob finished above Mya.  \n3. Ana finished below Eve → Eve finished above Ana.  \n4. Eve finished below Mya → Mya finished above Eve.  \n\nFrom 2 and 4:  \nRob > Mya > Eve.  \n\nFrom 3: Eve > Ana.  \n\nSo: Rob > Mya > Eve > Ana.  \n\nAmy is fixed at position 2.  \n\nLet’s try to fit Rob, Mya, Eve, Ana around Amy’s position 2.  \n\nIf Amy is 2nd, then 1st must be someone else.  \n\nRob is above Mya, Eve, and Ana. Could Rob be 1st?  \nIf Rob is 1st:  \nThen Mya is below Rob, so Mya could be 3rd, 4th, or 5th. But Mya > Eve > Ana.  \nSo Mya can’t be 5th (because then Eve and Ana would be below her but there’d be no room for both below her if she’s last). Let’s check systematically:  \n\nWe have positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  \nPos 2 = Amy.  \n\nRob = pos 1.  \nMya must be below Rob but above Eve.  \nEve must be above Ana.  \n\nPossible arrangement:  \n1: Rob  \n2: Amy  \n3: Mya  \n4: Eve  \n5: Ana  \n\nCheck:  \nMya below Rob? Yes (3 vs 1).  \nAna below Eve? Yes (5 vs 4).  \nAmy second? Yes.  \nEve below Mya? Yes (4 vs 3).  \n\nAll consistent.  \n\nSecond-to-last means 4th place.  \n4th place = Eve.  \n\nSo Eve finished second-to-last.  \n\nThe correct option is: C\nAnswer:\nC\n\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.\n\nIn a golf tournament, there were five golfers: Dan, Amy, Eve, Ana, and Mya. Dan finished above Eve. Dan finished below Mya. Amy finished third. Ana finished second-to-last.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is true?\nOptions:\nA) Dan finished last.\nB) Amy finished last.\nC) Eve finished last.\nD) Ana finished last.\nE) Mya finished last.\nReasoning:\nLet’s reason through the clues.\n\n1. Amy finished third:  \n   Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 → Amy is 3rd.\n\n2. Ana finished second-to-last:  \n   Second-to-last means 4th place (since there are 5 golfers). So Ana is 4th.\n\n3. Dan finished above Eve: Dan < Eve in ranking? No — \"finished above\" means better position → smaller position number. So Dan’s position number < Eve’s position number.\n\n4. Dan finished below Mya: Mya’s position number < Dan’s position number.\n\nFrom 3 and 4:  \nMya < Dan < Eve in position numbers (smaller number = higher finish).\n\nSo Mya, Dan, Eve are in that order in the ranking (not necessarily consecutive, but Mya before Dan before Eve).\n\nPossible positions:  \nWe know: Amy = 3, Ana = 4.  \nSo remaining positions: 1, 2, 5.\n\nMya, Dan, Eve must occupy three positions in that order: Mya first, then Dan, then Eve.\n\nThe only way Mya < Dan < Eve works with positions {1, 2, 5} is:  \nMya = 1, Dan = 2, Eve = 5.\n\nCheck:  \n1: Mya  \n2: Dan  \n3: Amy  \n4: Ana  \n5: Eve  \n\nThis satisfies all: Dan above Eve (2 < 5), Dan below Mya (2 > 1? Wait — \"Dan finished below Mya\" means worse position than Mya → Dan’s position number > Mya’s. Yes, 2 > 1, so Dan below Mya is satisfied.)  \nAmy 3rd, Ana 4th.\n\nSo last place (5th) is Eve.\n\nThe correct option is: C\nAnswer:\nC\n\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.

Cardinal is in 3 or 4.  \n4. \"The crow is the rightmost\" → Position 5 = Crow.  \n5. From step 3: If cardinal is in position 3, robin is in position 4 (since 5 is crow).  \n   If cardinal is in position 4, robin would have to be in position 5, but position 5 is crow → impossible.  \n   So cardinal must be in position 3, robin in position 4.  \n\nPositions:  \n1: ?  \n2: Blue Jay  \n3: Cardinal  \n4: Robin  \n5: Crow  \n\nThe remaining bird (Falcon) must be in position 1.  \n\nThus, second from the left is Blue Jay.  \n\nLooking at options:  \nE) The blue jay is the second from the left → True.  \n\nThe correct option is: E\nAnswer:\nE\n\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.

Dan finished 2nd.  \n2. Amy finished below Eve → Eve > Amy (in position number: smaller number = better finish).  \n3. Dan finished above Eve → Dan (2nd) > Eve → Eve’s position > 2 → Eve is 3rd, 4th, or 5th.  \n4. Amy finished above Eli → Amy > Eli.  \n\nFrom (3): Dan (2nd) > Eve → Eve’s position is at least 3rd.  \nFrom (2): Eve > Amy → Amy’s position is worse than Eve’s.  \nFrom (4): Amy > Eli → Eli is worse than Amy.  \n\nSo: Eve > Amy > Eli in finishing order (lower positions for Eve, then Amy, then Eli).  \n\nPossible positions for Eve:  \n• If Eve = 3rd → Amy = 4th or 5th? Wait, Amy > Eli, so if Eve=3, Amy=4 or 5, Eli=5 or lower (impossible since only 5 spots). Let’s check:  \n\nWe have 5 spots: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  \nDan = 2.  \nEve = 3 → Amy = 4 or 5. But Amy > Eli → Eli must be worse than Amy. If Amy=4, Eli=5. If Amy=5, Eli can’t be worse, so impossible. So Amy=4, Eli=5.  \n\nThen positions:  \n1: ?  \n2: Dan  \n3: Eve  \n4: Amy  \n5: Eli  \n\nRemaining position 1: Rob.  \n\nCheck:  \nRob=1, Dan=2, Eve=3, Amy=4, Eli=5.  \nAll conditions satisfied:  \n• Dan 2nd ✓  \n\n• Amy below Eve (4 vs 3) ✓  \n\n• Dan above Eve (2 vs 3) ✓  \n\n• Amy above Eli (4 vs 5) ✓  \n\nSo this works.  \n\nCould Eve be 4th?  \nIf Eve=4 → Amy=5 (since Amy below Eve, and Amy > Eli, but if Amy=5, Eli can’t be worse, so impossible). So Eve cannot be 4th or 5th.  \n\nThus only possibility: Eve = 3rd.  \n\nThe question asks: Which is true?  \nOptions:  \nA) Rob 3rd — no, Rob is 1st.  \nB) Eve 3rd — yes.  \nC) Eli 3rd — no, Eli 5th.  \nD) Amy 3rd — no, Amy 4th.  \nE) Dan 3rd — no, Dan 2nd.  \n\nThe correct option is: B\nAnswer:\nB\n\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.\n\nIn a golf tournament, there were five golfers: Dan, Amy, Eve, Ana, and Mya. Dan finished above Eve. Dan finished below Mya.

Ana finished second-to-last.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is true?\nOptions:\nA) Dan finished last.\nB) Amy finished last.\nC) Eve finished last.\nD) Ana finished last.\nE) Mya finished last.\nReasoning:\nLet’s reason through the clues.\n\n1. Amy finished third:  \n   Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 → Amy is 3rd.\n\n2. Ana finished second-to-last:  \n   Second-to-last means 4th place (since there are 5 golfers). So Ana is 4th.\n\n3. Dan finished above Eve: Dan < Eve in ranking? No — \"finished above\" means better position → smaller position number. So Dan’s position number < Eve’s position number.\n\n4. Dan finished below Mya: Mya’s position number < Dan’s position number.\n\nFrom 3 and 4:  \nMya < Dan < Eve in position numbers (smaller number = higher finish).\n\nSo Mya, Dan, Eve are in that order in the ranking (not necessarily consecutive, but Mya before Dan before Eve).\n\nPossible positions:  \nWe know: Amy = 3, Ana = 4.  \nSo remaining positions: 1, 2, 5.\n\nMya, Dan, Eve must occupy three positions in that order: Mya first, then Dan, then Eve.\n\nThe only way Mya < Dan < Eve works with positions {1, 2, 5} is:  \nMya = 1, Dan = 2, Eve = 5.\n\nCheck:  \n1: Mya  \n2: Dan  \n3: Amy  \n4: Ana  \n5: Eve  \n\nThis satisfies all: Dan above Eve (2 < 5), Dan below Mya (2 > 1? Wait — \"Dan finished below Mya\" means worse position than Mya → Dan’s position number > Mya’s. Yes, 2 > 1, so Dan below Mya is satisfied.)  \nAmy 3rd, Ana 4th.\n\nSo last place (5th) is Eve.\n\nThe correct option is: C\nAnswer:\nC\n\n"}

Ailton Silva was loaned out to a football club.", "retrieved_demonstrations": "Given a problem statement as contexts, the task is to answer a logical reasoning question. \n------\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.\n\nIn a golf tournament, there were five golfers: Dan, Amy, Eve, Ana, and Mya. Dan finished above Eve. Dan finished below Mya. Amy finished third. Ana finished second-to-last.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is true?\nOptions:\nA) Dan finished last.\nB) Amy finished last.\nC) Eve finished last.\nD) Ana finished last.\nE) Mya finished last.\nReasoning:\nLet’s reason through the clues.\n\n1. Amy finished third:  \n   Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 → Amy is 3rd.\n\n2. Ana finished second-to-last:  \n   Second-to-last means 4th place (since there are 5 golfers). So Ana is 4th.\n\n3. Dan finished above Eve: Dan < Eve in ranking? No — \"finished above\" means better position → smaller position number. So Dan’s position number < Eve’s position number.\n\n4. Dan finished below Mya: Mya’s position number < Dan’s position number.\n\nFrom 3 and 4:  \nMya < Dan < Eve in position numbers (smaller number = higher finish).\n\nSo Mya, Dan, Eve are in that order in the ranking (not necessarily consecutive, but Mya before Dan before Eve).\n\nPossible positions:  \nWe know: Amy = 3, Ana = 4.  \nSo remaining positions: 1, 2, 5.\n\nMya, Dan, Eve must occupy three positions in that order: Mya first, then Dan, then Eve.\n\nThe only way Mya < Dan < Eve works with positions {1, 2, 5} is:  \nMya = 1, Dan = 2, Eve = 5.\n\nCheck:  \n1: Mya  \n2: Dan  \n3: Amy  \n4: Ana  \n5: Eve  \n\nThis satisfies all: Dan above Eve (2 < 5), Dan below Mya (2 > 1? Wait — \"Dan finished below Mya\" means worse position than Mya → Dan’s position number > Mya’s. Yes, 2 > 1, so Dan below Mya is satisfied.)  \nAmy 3rd, Ana 4th.\n\nSo last place (5th) is Eve.\n\nThe correct option is: C\nAnswer:\nC\n\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order.

Dan finished above Eve. Amy finished above Eli.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is true?\nOptions:\nA) Rob finished third.\nB) Eve finished third.\nC) Eli finished third.\nD) Amy finished third.\nE) Dan finished third.\nReasoning:\nLet’s reason it out step by step.  \n\nWe have 5 golfers: Rob, Eve, Eli, Amy, Dan.  \nPositions: 1st (highest) to 5th (lowest).  \n\nGiven facts:  \n1. Dan finished 2nd.  \n2. Amy finished below Eve → Eve > Amy (in position number: smaller number = better finish).  \n3. Dan finished above Eve → Dan (2nd) > Eve → Eve’s position > 2 → Eve is 3rd, 4th, or 5th.  \n4. Amy finished above Eli → Amy > Eli.  \n\nFrom (3): Dan (2nd) > Eve → Eve’s position is at least 3rd.  \nFrom (2): Eve > Amy → Amy’s position is worse than Eve’s.  \nFrom (4): Amy > Eli → Eli is worse than Amy.  \n\nSo: Eve > Amy > Eli in finishing order (lower positions for Eve, then Amy, then Eli).  \n\nPossible positions for Eve:  \n• If Eve = 3rd → Amy = 4th or 5th? Wait, Amy > Eli, so if Eve=3, Amy=4 or 5, Eli=5 or lower (impossible since only 5 spots). Let’s check:  \n\nWe have 5 spots: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  \nDan = 2.  \nEve = 3 → Amy = 4 or 5. But Amy > Eli → Eli must be worse than Amy. If Amy=4, Eli=5. If Amy=5, Eli can’t be worse, so impossible. So Amy=4, Eli=5.  \n\nThen positions:  \n1: ?  \n2: Dan  \n3: Eve  \n4: Amy  \n5: Eli  \n\nRemaining position 1: Rob.  \n\nCheck:  \nRob=1, Dan=2, Eve=3, Amy=4, Eli=5.  \nAll conditions satisfied:  \n• Dan 2nd ✓  \n\n• Amy below Eve (4 vs 3) ✓  \n\n• Dan above Eve (2 vs 3) ✓  \n\n• Amy above Eli (4 vs 5) ✓  \n\nSo this works.  \n\nCould Eve be 4th?  \nIf Eve=4 → Amy=5 (since Amy below Eve, and Amy > Eli, but if Amy=5, Eli can’t be worse, so impossible). So Eve cannot be 4th or 5th.  \n\nThus only possibility: Eve = 3rd.  \n\nThe question asks: Which is true?  \nOptions:  \nA) Rob 3rd — no, Rob is 1st.  \nB) Eve 3rd — yes.  \nC) Eli 3rd — no, Eli 5th.  \nD) Amy 3rd — no, Amy 4th.  \nE) Dan 3rd — no, Dan 2nd.  \n\nThe correct option is: B\nAnswer:\nB\n\nContext:\nThe following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order.
