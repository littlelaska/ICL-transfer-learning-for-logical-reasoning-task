    "reasoning_cot": "Let’s break this down step by step.\n\n1. Restating the context in logical form\n\nLet:  \n• P = perform in school talent shows often  \n\n• E = attend and very engaged with school events  \n\n• I = inactive and disinterested member of community  \n\n• C = chaperone high school dances  \n\n• S = student who attends the school  \n\n• Y = young child or teenager who wishes to further academic career and educational opportunities  \n\nGiven:  \n1. If P, then E.  \n   P \\rightarrow E  \n2. Either P or I (exclusive or? The wording is “People either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community” — likely exclusive “or” but not necessarily; here “either A or B” often means at least one is true, maybe both? Wait, check: \"People either A or B\" often means every person satisfies A or B; but later it says “If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not S” and “All I chaperone high school dances” — so not everyone can be I because then everyone would chaperone and thus not S, but Y are S, contradiction if Y exists. So maybe A or B covers all people, exclusive? Possibly inclusive? Let’s see constraints.)  \n\n   Let’s keep as: P \\vee I (logical OR) for now, not exclusive.  \n3. If C, then not S.  \n   C \\rightarrow \\neg S  \n4. All I chaperone high school dances: I \\rightarrow C  \n5. All Y are S: Y \\rightarrow S  \n6. Bonnie: either (E and S) or (not E and not S) — exclusive or (XOR).  \n   \\((E \\wedge S) \\oplus (\\neg E \\wedge \\neg S)\\) = E \\leftrightarrow S (since both true or both false means E and S are logically equivalent for Bonnie).  \n   So Bonnie: E iff S.\n\n2. Implications from the general rules\n\nFrom (2): P \\vee I for any person.  \nFrom (4) I \\rightarrow C and (3) C \\rightarrow \\neg S, so I \\rightarrow \\neg S.  \nFrom (1) P \\rightarrow E. No direct link from P to S except through E? Wait E and S are independent in general, but for Bonnie they’re equivalent.\n\nFrom (5) Y \\rightarrow S, so Y \\rightarrow S and S \\rightarrow E (for Bonnie only) and E \\rightarrow ??? We know E could come from P, but not necessarily only from P. Actually statement 1 says P→E, but E could happen without P? Possibly yes, because (2) says P or I, so if not P then I, but if I then not S (from I→¬S), so not E (for Bonnie: not S→not E). So for Bonnie:  \n• If not P, then I (since P∨I), then ¬S (I→¬S), then ¬E (since E↔S).  \n\n• If P, then E (P→E) and from E↔S, S is true.  \n\nThus for Bonnie:  \nP → E and S  \n¬P → I and ¬S and ¬E  \n\nSo Bonnie’s case is fully determined by P:  \nP = true ⇒ E=true, S=true  \nP = false ⇒ I=true, S=false, E=false.\n\nAlso, from I ⇒ C (true for Bonnie if I).\n\n3. Question statement in logic\n\nStatement: “If Bonnie is either (both Y and C) or (neither Y nor C), then Bonnie is either S or I.”  \n\nLet’s symbolize:  \nCondition: (Y ∧ C) ∨ (¬Y ∧ ¬C)  \nThis is just Y ↔ C (since Y∧C) or (¬Y∧¬C) means Y and C have same truth value).  \n\nConclusion: S ∨ I.\n\nWe need: Does (Y ↔ C) → (S ∨ I) hold for Bonnie given the constraints?\n\n4. Check cases for Bonnie\n\nWe know Bonnie has two possible scenarios from earlier:\n\nCase 1: P true  \nThen: E=true, S=true, I=false (since if P, not necessarily I? Wait, (2) P∨I, so both could be true? No, I→¬S, but here S is true, so I must be false.) Yes: I→¬S, contrapositive S→¬I. So S true ⇒ I false.  \nSo in Case 1: S=true, I=false, so S∨I = true.  \nSo regardless of Y and C, conclusion S∨I is true. So implication (Y↔C)→(S∨I) is true in Case 1 (since conclusion is true).\n\nCase 2: P false  \nThen: I=true (since P∨I and not P ⇒ I),  \nI⇒C (true), so C=true.  \nS=false (since I→¬S), E=false.  \n\nNow S∨I = true (since I=true). Again conclusion is true regardless of Y.  \n\nSo in both possible cases for Bonnie, S∨I is true.  \n\nThus the implication (Y↔C) → (S∨I) is vacuously true for Bonnie because S∨I is always true for her.\n\n5. Verify S∨I always true for Bonnie\n\nCase 1: S true ⇒ S∨I true.  \nCase 2: I true ⇒ S∨I true.  \n\nYes.\n\n6. Final\n\nSo the statement in the question is true.\n\nThe correct option is: A"

If  Y , then  S .  \n    Y \\to S   \n\n6. Bonnie: either (E and S) or (not E and not S).  \n   \\( (E \\land S) \\lor (\\lnot E \\land \\lnot S) \\)  \n   (This means  E  and  S  have the same truth value for Bonnie: both true or both false.)\n\n2. Implications from premises:\n\nFrom (2) and (1):  \n• If  P  is true, then  E  is true (from 1).  \n\n• If  P  is false, then  I  is true (from 2:  P \\lor I  is exclusive? No, it says \"either ... or ...\" but not \"exclusive or\" necessarily; but in logic \"either A or B\" often means at least one, maybe both unless exclusive. But here, can someone be both  P  and  I ? Possibly not, but not stated exclusive. But check: if  P  true →  E  true. But  I  means inactive/disinterested, inconsistent with  E  (engaged). So  P  and  I  cannot both be true. So effectively exclusive.) Let’s treat as exclusive:  P  xor  I . Actually, not given exclusive, but if both  P  and  I  were true, that’s contradictory because  E  and  I  are incompatible (since  I  implies inactive,  E  implies engaged). So indeed  P  and  I  can’t both be true. So  P \\lor I  is \"or\", but not exclusive, but they are mutually inconsistent. So for any person, exactly one of  P, I  is true.  \n\nFrom (4)  I \\to C , and (3)  C \\to \\lnot S , so  I \\to \\lnot S .  \n\nFrom (1)  P \\to E .  \n\nAlso from (5)  Y \\to S .  \n\n3. Bonnie’s case from (6):\n\nTwo cases for Bonnie:  \n\nCase 1:  E  true,  S  true.  \n•  E  true →  P  must be true? Wait,  E  could be true without  P  if there’s another way to be engaged? Premises don’t say  E  only if  P . But (2) says everyone either  P  or  I . If  E  true, can  I  be true? No,  I  means inactive/disinterested, inconsistent with  E  (engaged). So if  E  true, then  I  false, so by (2)  P  true.  \n\nSo  E  true →  P  true.  \n\nSo in Case 1:  E  true,  S  true →  P  true,  I  false,  C  false (since  C  true →  \\lnot S , but  S  true).  \n\nCase 2:  E  false,  S  false.  \n•  E  false →  P  false? If  E  false, could  P  be true? No, because  P  true →  E  true. So  P  false.  \n\nFrom (2)  P \\lor I , so  I  true.  \nFrom (4)  I  true →  C  true.  \nFrom (3)  C  true →  \\lnot S  true, consistent with  S  false.  \n\nSo Bonnie’s cases:  \n• Case 1:  E, S, P  true;  I, C  false.  \n\n• Case 2:  E, S, P  false;  I, C  true.  \n\n4. The statement to evaluate:  \n\n\"If Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\"  \n\nSymbolically:  \nStatement = \\( [C \\lor (\\lnot C \\to P)] \\to (Y \\land I) \\).  \n\nSimplify antecedent:  \\lnot C \\to P  is equivalent to  C \\lor P . So antecedent is: \\( C \\lor (C \\lor P) \\) =  C \\lor P .  \n\nSo statement = \\( (C \\lor P) \\to (Y \\land I) \\).  \n\n5. Evaluate in each case:\n\nCase 1:  C  false,  P  true →  C \\lor P  = true.  \nConsequent  Y \\land I :  I  false, so false.  \nSo implication: True → False ⇒ False in Case 1.  \n\nSo in Case 1, the whole statement is false.  \n\nSince the statement says \"Based on the information, is the following statement true?\" — meaning: is it necessarily true given the context? We see it’s not necessarily true (it’s false in Case 1).  \n\nBut maybe they mean: is the statement true about Bonnie given the info? That would mean: is the implication’s antecedent true and consequent true in Bonnie’s actual case? But we don’t know which case Bonnie is in.  \n\nBut the question: \"Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain?\"  \n\nIf the scenario is such that the statement’s antecedent  C \\lor P  is true in both cases, then we check consequent  Y \\land I .  \n\nCheck:  \nCase 1:  C \\lor P  = true,  Y \\land I  = false (since I false).  \nCase 2:  C  true,  P  false →  C \\lor P  = true,  Y \\land I :  I  true, but  Y ?  Y \\to S  (premise 5). In Case 2,  S  false, so  Y  false (because if  Y  true then  S  true). So  Y \\land I  = false.  \n\nSo in both cases of Bonnie,  C \\lor P  is true, and  Y \\land I  is false.  \n\nThus the implication \\( (C \\lor P) \\to (Y \\land I) \\) is false in both cases (since antecedent true, consequent false).  \n\nSo the statement as a whole is false for Bonnie.  \n\n6. Conclusion:\n\nThe statement in the question is false, not uncertain, because given the constraints, Bonnie must be in one of two cases, and in both the implication is false.  \n\nThe correct option is: B"

So the hypothesis adds that Rock is cute.  \n\nStep 2 – What can we deduce from “Rock is still” alone?  \nFrom fact 4: If skittish → not still.  \nContrapositive: If still → not skittish.  \n\nSo Rock is not skittish.  \n\nStep 3 – If Rock is an animal, what is Rock?  \nFact 3: An animal is either a rabbit or a squirrel.  \nFact 5: All squirrels are skittish.  \nRock is not skittish → Rock cannot be a squirrel.  \nSo if Rock is an animal, Rock must be a rabbit.  \n\nStep 4 – If Rock is a rabbit, is Rock cute?  \nFact 1: All rabbits are cute → Yes, Rock would be cute.  \n\nSo the hypothesis “Rock is cute and still” is consistent with Rock being a rabbit.  \n\nStep 5 – Check the conclusion of the conditional statement:  \nConclusion: “Rock is a turtle and skittish.”  \n\nWe already know Rock is not skittish (from Step 2).  \nSo the conclusion is false whenever the hypothesis is true.  \n\nStep 6 – Truth value of the whole implication “If H then C”:  \nIf H is true, C is false → implication is false.  \nSo the statement “If Rock is cute and still, then Rock is a turtle and skittish” is false.  \n\nThe correct option is: B"

No, it says \"either ... or\" in the exclusive sense? Actually, the statement: \"A person is either a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor\" — this seems like it means everyone in the universe of people we’re talking about is one or the other, but that’s unrealistic. Possibly they mean: In this context, \"a person\" (meaning Djokovic) is one or the other? No, it’s a general statement: Every person is either a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor. That’s clearly false in real life, but in logic puzzles, we take it as given. So: All people in this scenario belong to exactly one of these two categories.)  \n\n2. All Grand Slam champions are professional tennis players.  \n3. All Oscar-nominated actors are celebrities.  \n4. All professional tennis players are athletes.  \n5. If a person is a celebrity, then they are well paid.  \n6. If a person is an athlete, then they are famous.  \n7. All well-paid people live in tax havens.  \n\n8. If Djokovic is famous and is an athlete, then Djokovic lives in well paid.  \n   • This seems redundant: from 6, if he’s an athlete, he’s famous. So \"famous and athlete\" = just athlete. Then \"lives in well paid\" probably means \"is well paid\". Possibly a typo: \"lives in well-paid [place]\" → but statement 7 says well-paid people live in tax havens. So maybe they meant \"Djokovic is well paid\".  \n\nStep 2 – What do we know about Djokovic?  \nThe only info about Djokovic is in statement 8: If Djokovic is famous and is an athlete, then he is well paid.  \nBut from statement 6, if he is an athlete, he is famous. So statement 8 just says: If Djokovic is an athlete, then he is well paid.  \n\nBut do we know Djokovic is an athlete? Not directly given.  \n\nStep 3 – Could we deduce Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion?  \nWe know:  \n• Every person is either a Grand Slam champion (GSC) or an Oscar-nominated actor (ONA).  \n\n• If GSC → professional tennis player → athlete → famous.  \n\n• If ONA → celebrity → well paid.  \n\nSo all people in this scenario are either athletes (if GSC) or well-paid (if ONA).  \n\nBut Djokovic’s category is not given.  \n\nWe know from statement 8: If Djokovic is an athlete, then he is well paid. But that’s automatically true? Not necessarily: athlete → famous (from 6), but famous doesn’t imply well paid unless famous people are all well paid (not stated). So 8 is an extra fact linking athlete to well-paid for Djokovic specifically.  \n\nBut still, we don’t know if Djokovic is GSC or ONA.  \n\nStep 4 – Could we deduce he is GSC from \"Djokovic is famous and is an athlete\" being true?  \nBut that’s the antecedent of statement 8 — we don’t know if it’s true.  \n\nWait — maybe they slipped: In real life, Djokovic is a tennis champion. But in this puzzle, we can’t use outside knowledge.  \n\nGiven the statements, there’s no info that Djokovic is an athlete or a celebrity. So his category is unknown.  \n\nSince all people are either GSC or ONA, Djokovic must be one of them. But which?  \n\nIf he’s GSC, then he’s an athlete. If he’s ONA, then he’s a celebrity. But we’re not told he’s an athlete or celebrity.  \n\nThus, we cannot determine whether he is GSC.  \n\nStep 5 – Conclusion  \nThe information given does not allow us to determine if Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion.  \n\nFinal answer:  \n\nThe correct option is: C"

(This seems too strong — maybe it means \"in this context\" or for the people we’re talking about? But likely it’s a general statement for the puzzle.)  \n\n   • All Grand Slam champions are professional tennis players.  \n\n   • All Oscar-nominated actors are celebrities.  \n\n   • All professional tennis players are athletes.  \n\n   • If a person is a celebrity, then they are well paid.  \n\n   • If a person is an athlete, then they are famous.  \n\n   • All well-paid people live in tax havens.  \n\n2. Extra statement:  \n   • \"If Djokovic is famous and is an athlete, then Djokovic lives in well paid.\"  \n\n   This seems like a mistyped conclusion — maybe they meant \"lives in a tax haven\" or \"is well paid.\" But as written, it’s an if–then:  \n   If (Djokovic is famous AND Djokovic is an athlete) → Djokovic lives in well paid.  \n\n3. We are told to evaluate:  \n   \"Djokovic lives in a tax haven.\"  \n\n4. What do we know about Djokovic?  \n   The only info about Djokovic is in that last conditional statement, but that’s a conditional, not a fact.  \n   The premises don’t tell us whether Djokovic is famous or an athlete — except that in real life we know he is, but logically, from the given statements alone, we aren’t told that.  \n\n5. Check if we can deduce Djokovic’s status from the general premises:  \n   • The first premise says everyone is either a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor.  \n\n   • If Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion → professional tennis player → athlete → famous.  \n\n   • If Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor → celebrity → well paid → lives in tax haven.  \n\n   So in either case, Djokovic would be either famous (if athlete) or well paid (if celebrity). But to conclude \"lives in tax haven,\" we need him to be well paid.  \n\n6. Does being an athlete make him well paid?  \n   • Athlete → famous, but famous doesn’t imply well paid from the given rules.  \n\n   • But if he’s a Grand Slam champion → athlete AND also professional tennis player. That doesn’t directly give well paid.  \n\n   • Wait — celebrity → well paid. But is an athlete a celebrity? Not necessarily from these rules.  \n\n   • However, if he’s an Oscar-nominated actor, then celebrity → well paid → tax haven.  \n\n   • If he’s a Grand Slam champion, is he a celebrity? Not stated. So maybe not necessarily well paid.  \n\n7. But the puzzle’s first premise says: each person is either Grand Slam champion or Oscar-nominated actor.  \n   So Djokovic must be one or the other.  \n   • If Grand Slam champion: pro tennis player → athlete → famous. But not necessarily well paid unless we have an extra link.  \n\n   • If Oscar-nominated actor: celebrity → well paid → tax haven.  \n\n8. So is it certain he lives in a tax haven?  \n   No — because if he’s a Grand Slam champion, we don’t know that he is well paid.  \n   But wait — the last given statement: \"If Djokovic is famous and is an athlete, then Djokovic lives in well paid.\"  \n   If Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion, then he’s an athlete and famous (as we deduced). Then that if–then applies:  \n   Since he’s famous and an athlete, the conditional says: he lives in well paid (meaning he is well paid).  \n   Well paid → tax haven.  \n\n9. So in both cases:  \n   • Oscar-nominated actor → well paid → tax haven.  \n\n   • Grand Slam champion → athlete & famous → (by the last if–then) well paid → tax haven.  \n\nThus, in all possible scenarios from the premises, Djokovic lives in a tax haven.  \n\nConclusion: The statement is true.  \n\nThe correct option is: A"

All Grand Slam champions are professional tennis players.  \n3. All Oscar-nominated actors are celebrities.  \n4. All professional tennis players are athletes.  \n5. If a person is a celebrity → they are well paid.  \n6. If a person is an athlete → they are famous.  \n7. All well-paid people live in tax havens.  \n8. If Djokovic is famous and is an athlete → Djokovic lives in well paid. (This seems like a garbled restatement; maybe it means “Djokovic is well paid”.)  \n\nStep 1 – Determine Djokovic’s possible categories.  \nFrom (1), Djokovic is either:  \n• Grand Slam champion → professional tennis player (2) → athlete (4) → famous (6).  \n\n• Oscar-nominated actor → celebrity (3) → well paid (5) → lives in tax haven (7).  \n\nSo either category leads to a chain.  \n\nStep 2 – See what is given about Djokovic in the question.  \nThe question doesn’t explicitly state which category Djokovic is in, but the last statement in the context says:  \nIf Djokovic is famous and is an athlete, then Djokovic lives in well paid.  \n\nBut we know from (6): if athlete → famous. So “famous and athlete” is equivalent to “athlete”.  \nSo that last statement means: If Djokovic is an athlete → Djokovic is well paid.  \n\nBut is Djokovic an athlete?  \nIf he’s a Grand Slam champion → athlete (yes).  \nIf he’s an Oscar-nominated actor → not necessarily an athlete (unless other facts force it, but they don’t).  \n\nSo we don’t know if he’s an athlete unless we know his category.  \n\nStep 3 – But maybe we can deduce his category from the name “Djokovic” (real-world knowledge intrusion?).  \nThe problem says “Based on the above information” — so ignore real-world knowledge. Then:  \nFrom (1), he must be one or the other, but we don’t know which.  \n\nCase 1: Grand Slam champion → athlete → famous → well paid (from the last “if” statement in context, since athlete → famous, so antecedent true) → lives in tax haven (7).  \n\nCase 2: Oscar-nominated actor → celebrity → well paid → lives in tax haven.  \n\nSo in both cases, Djokovic is well paid (because both paths lead to well-paid:  \n• Grand Slam champion → athlete → well paid (via the last given conditional)  \n\n• Oscar-nominated actor → celebrity → well paid (via 5)  \n\nWait, check Case 1 path carefully:  \nGrand Slam champion → professional tennis player → athlete → famous.  \nNow, “If famous and athlete → well paid” — yes, in Case 1, famous and athlete are both true, so he’s well paid.  \n\nThus in both possible categories, Djokovic is well paid.  \n\nStep 4 – Well paid → lives in tax haven (7).  \nSo Djokovic lives in a tax haven.  \n\nThe statement in the question: “Djokovic does not live in a tax haven” is therefore false.  \n\nStep 5 – Conclusion.  \nThe correct option is:  \n\nThe correct option is: B"

From premise 3: All female tennis players at RG 2022 lost to Iga Świątek.  \n   • So Coco Gauff lost to Iga Świątek.  \n\n4. From premise 2: Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek is highly ranked by WTA.  \n   • So Coco Gauff is highly ranked by WTA.  \n\n5. From premise 6: If (highly ranked by WTA) or (lost to Rafael Nadal), then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at RG 2022.  \n   • Since she is highly ranked by WTA, the antecedent is true, so the consequent is true: she is not a male tennis player at RG 2022.  \n\n   • But we already know she is female, so that’s consistent.  \n\n6. But the question: Has Coco Gauff lost to Rafael Nadal?  \n   • We know she lost to Iga Świątek, but nothing says she lost to Nadal.  \n\n   • She is female, so she is not in the set “male tennis players at RG 2022” who all lost to Nadal.  \n\n   • Therefore, we have no information that she lost to Nadal.  \n\n7. Could she have lost to Nadal in some other context?  \n   • The context is RG 2022: males lost to Nadal, females lost to Świątek.  \n\n   • She is female, so at RG 2022 she did not play Nadal.  \n\n   • Outside RG 2022? Not mentioned, so we can’t assume she did.  \n\n8. Thus, the statement “Coco Gauff has lost to Rafael Nadal” is not supported by the given premises.  \n   • But is it necessarily false?  \n\n   • The premises only describe RG 2022 matches: females lost to Świątek, males to Nadal.  \n\n   • It doesn’t say a player can’t lose to both in different tournaments, but the question likely means “based on the given info, did she lose to Nadal?” → No evidence, so false in the logical sense (meaning “it is not the case that she lost to Nadal” based on the given facts).  \n\nWait — but “false” means it’s proven she did not lose to Nadal. Do we know that?  \n• At RG 2022, she didn’t lose to Nadal (she’s female, so she didn’t play him there).  \n\n• The text doesn’t mention any other matches, so we can’t conclude she never lost to him in her career.  \n\n• So actually, the information is insufficient to conclude she lost to him, and also insufficient to conclude she never lost to him outside RG 2022.  \n\nThus the answer is uncertain (we don’t know from given info).  \n\nFinal reasoning: The data only covers RG 2022; we can’t infer about other tournaments, so it’s uncertain.  \n\nThe correct option is: C"

Everyone who lost to Iga Świątek is highly ranked by WTA.  \n   (LostToIga → HighRank)  \n\n3. All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga Świątek.  \n   (FemaleRG22 → LostToIga)  \n\n4. Either female tennis players at RG22 or male tennis players at RG22.  \n   (This seems like a “Tennis player at RG22” is either female or male — but possibly incomplete as stated. But in context: “Everyone at RG22 is either female or male.”)  \n\n5. All male tennis players at RG22 lost to Rafael Nadal.  \n   (MaleRG22 → LostToNadal)  \n\n6. If Coco Gauff is (highly ranked by WTA) or (lost to Rafael Nadal), then Coco Gauff is not male at RG22.  \n   (HighRank OR LostToNadal) → NOT MaleRG22  \n\n2. Question statement:  \nCoco Gauff is not a player who lost to Iga Świątek or one of the most active players in major tennis.  \n\nIn logic: NOT (LostToIga OR MostActive)  \n\nEquivalently: NOT LostToIga AND NOT MostActive.  \n\nWe need to check if this is necessarily true given the facts.  \n\n3. Possible inferences about Coco Gauff.  \n\nFrom (2) and (1): LostToIga → HighRank → MostActive.  \nSo LostToIga → MostActive.  \n\nThus, “NOT MostActive” → “NOT LostToIga” (contrapositive).  \n\nSo the statement “NOT LostToIga AND NOT MostActive” is equivalent to just “NOT MostActive” (because NOT MostActive implies NOT LostToIga).  \n\nSo the question reduces to: Is Coco Gauff necessarily NOT MostActive?  \n\n4. Do we know Coco Gauff’s situation?  \n\nWe know:  \n• If Coco is FemaleRG22 → LostToIga → MostActive.  \n\n• If Coco is MaleRG22 → LostToNadal → (HighRank OR LostToNadal) is true (since LostToNadal is true) → triggers rule 6: NOT MaleRG22.  \n\nBut wait — rule 6 says: (HighRank OR LostToNadal) → NOT MaleRG22.  \n\nSo if Coco were MaleRG22, then LostToNadal is true, so (HighRank OR LostToNadal) is true, so NOT MaleRG22. That’s a contradiction.  \n\nTherefore, Coco Gauff cannot be MaleRG22.  \n\nSo Coco Gauff is either:  \n• FemaleRG22, or  \n\n• Not at RG22 at all.  \n\n5. Case 1: Coco is FemaleRG22.  \nThen LostToIga (fact 3) → MostActive.  \nSo she is MostActive.  \nThen the statement “NOT (LostToIga OR MostActive)” is false.  \n\n6. Case 2: Coco is not at RG22.  \nWe know nothing about her LostToIga status or HighRank status from the given facts.  \nCould she be MostActive? Possibly yes (if she’s HighRank for other reasons). Possibly no.  \nSo in this case, “NOT MostActive” is uncertain.  \n\n7. But can Coco be not at RG22 and still be forced to be MostActive?  \n\nNo. The only path to MostActive in the given facts is:  \nLostToIga → HighRank → MostActive, or directly HighRank → MostActive.  \nBut we don’t know if she lost to Iga or is HighRank if she’s not at RG22.  \n\nSo it’s possible she is not MostActive.  \n\n8. Is the statement “NOT (LostToIga OR MostActive)” necessarily true?  \n\nNo — in Case 1 it’s false.  \nWe don’t know which case holds.  \n\nSo the truth value of the statement is uncertain.  \n\nFinal answer:  \n\nThe correct option is: C"

Since no domesticated animals are alligators, the hypothetical Ted-as-cow can’t coexist with Ted-as-alligator without contradiction.  \n\n   • Because the antecedent is impossible given the facts, the implication is true regardless of the consequent.  \n\nConclusion: The statement “If Ted is a cow, then Ted is not a pet” is logically true given the premises.  \n\nThe correct option is: A"

What do we know about Mary specifically?  \n\nWe know the general rules apply to Mary as well (since she’s a person in the context).  \nWe are told: \"If Mary works in student jobs on campus and needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, then Mary is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.\"  \n\nThe consequent says \"needs to earn money\" is false, but that contradicts the antecedent saying she needs to earn money.  \nSo the only way the implication is true: the antecedent must be false.  \n\nSo:  \n\\[\n\\neg (W_m \\land M_m)\n\\]\nThat is:  \\neg W_m \\lor \\neg M_m  … (A)  \n\n3. Could Mary need money ( M_m ) given (A)?  \n\nIf  M_m  is true, then from (A),  \\neg W_m  must be true (since not both).  \nSo  M_m  true →  W_m  false.  \n\nBut from general rules:  W \\rightarrow M  (anyone who works needs money).  \nBut  M \\rightarrow W  is not necessarily true (someone may need money but not work on campus).  \n\nSo Mary could need money but not work on campus.  \n\n4. Is there any rule forcing Mary to need money?  \n\nNo general rule says everyone needs money.  \nWe only know: if you work on campus, you need money; if you order takeout, you work on campus; everyone either orders takeout or enjoys dining hall (or both).  \n\nSo possibilities for Mary:  \n\n• If  O_m : then  W_m , then  M_m . But then  W_m \\land M_m  is true, which contradicts (A) above.  \n\nSo  O_m  cannot be true for Mary.  \n\nThus  \\neg O_m .  \n\nFrom  O \\lor E , we get  E_m  (she enjoys dining hall).  \n\nFrom  E \\rightarrow \\neg P  and  E \\rightarrow S , we know she’s not picky and spends time in dining halls.  \n\n5. Does  E_m  tell us about  M_m ?  \n\nNo rule links E to M or to W directly except through O.  \nWe know  E_m  and  \\neg O_m .  \n\nFrom  \\neg O_m , we have  \\neg W_m  (because  O \\rightarrow W , contrapositive:  \\neg W \\rightarrow \\neg O  — wait, careful:  O \\rightarrow W  means  \\neg W \\rightarrow \\neg O , which we already used to deduce  \\neg W_m  from  \\neg O_m ? Actually, we deduced  \\neg O_m  first, so we cannot deduce  \\neg W_m  from that alone — because  O \\rightarrow W  doesn’t mean  \\neg O \\rightarrow \\neg W . So maybe  W_m  could still be true without O? Let’s check:  \n\nWe have  \\neg O_m .  \nWe have  O \\lor E , so  E_m .  \nNo rule says  E \\rightarrow \\neg W . So  W_m  could be true or false.  \n\nBut wait — if  W_m  is true, then from  W \\rightarrow M ,  M_m  is true. But then  W_m \\land M_m  is true, which contradicts (A). So  W_m  cannot be true.  \n\nThus  \\neg W_m .  \n\n6. So  \\neg W_m , and  E_m .  \n\nNow,  M_m ?  W \\rightarrow M , but we don’t have  M \\rightarrow W , so  M_m  could be true or false.  \n\nNo other rules force  M_m  to be true or false.  \n\nSo we cannot determine whether Mary needs money.  \n\n7. Check if any hidden constraint:  \n\nThe last statement only forbids  W_m \\land M_m , which we already used to get  \\neg W_m  (since  O_m  false and  E_m  true,  W_m  would imply  M_m , causing the forbidden conjunction). So  \\neg W_m  settled.  \n\nThus  M_m  is possible but not necessary.  \n\nSo the answer to “Mary needs to earn money…” is uncertain.  \n\nThe correct option is: C"

All products of Baked by Melissa are cupcakes.  \n5. If dried Thai chilies are spicy or a bakery, then dried Thai chilies are a hotpot or are spicy.  \n\nStep 1 – Understanding the conditional statement (premise 5)  \nPremise 5:  \nIf dried Thai chilies are spicy or a bakery, then dried Thai chilies are a hotpot or are spicy.  \n\nLet’s abbreviate:  \nD = dried Thai chilies  \nS = spicy  \nB = bakery  \nH = hotpot  \n\nPremise 5: (S(D) ∨ B(D)) → (H(D) ∨ S(D))  \n\nThis is a tautology? Let’s check:  \nIf S(D) is true, then H(D) ∨ S(D) is true (because S(D) is true).  \nIf S(D) is false, then the antecedent is B(D) true. Then the consequent is H(D) ∨ false = H(D). So the statement says: if B(D) then H(D).  \n\nSo actually premise 5 is logically equivalent to:  \nIf S(D) then (H(D) ∨ S(D)) [tautology when S(D) true]  \nIf not S(D) and B(D) then H(D).  \n\nSo the only non-trivial part: If (B(D) and not S(D)) then H(D).  \n\nBut H(D) → spicy (premise 3), so H(D) → S(D).  \nSo if B(D) and not S(D) then H(D) → S(D) → contradiction with not S(D).  \nSo the only way premise 5 can be true is if the antecedent is false whenever B(D) is true and S(D) false? Let’s check:  \n\nTruth table:  \nS(D) B(D) Antecedent (S∨B) Consequent (H∨S)\n Premise 5 true?  \nF F F ? (H∨F = H)\n T regardless of H.  \nF T T H∨F = H\n Must be T → so H must be T.  \nT F T H∨T = T\n T.  \nT T T H∨T = T\n T.  \n\nSo the only case that forces something:  \nIf B(D) is true and S(D) is false, then H(D) must be true.  \nBut H(D) true → S(D) true (premise 3).  \nSo S(D) false and S(D) true → contradiction.  \n\nTherefore, the case (B(D) true and S(D) false) is impossible.  \nSo B(D) → S(D) (to avoid contradiction).  \n\nBut premise 1: No bakery is spicy: B → not S.  \nSo B(D) → not S (premise 1) and B(D) → S(D) (from avoiding contradiction in premise 5).  \nThus B(D) → contradiction.  \n\nTherefore, B(D) must be false.  \nSo Dried Thai chilies are not a bakery.  \n\nStep 2 – Link to Baked by Melissa  \nAll products of Baked by Melissa are cupcakes (premise 4).  \nAll cupcakes are bakeries (premise 2).  \nSo all products of Baked by Melissa are bakeries.  \n\nWe deduced D is not a bakery.  \nSo D cannot be a product of Baked by Melissa.  \n\nThus the statement “Dried Thai chilies are not a product of Baked by Melissa” is true.  \n\nStep 3 – Check for uncertainty  \nNo uncertainty remains because the logic was deductive and led to a necessary conclusion.  \n\nThe correct option is: A"

All products of Baked by Melissa are cupcakes.  \n5. If dried Thai chilies are spicy or a bakery, then dried Thai chilies are a hotpot or are spicy.  \n\nStep 1 – Understanding the conditional statement (5)  \n(5) says:  \nIf (dried Thai chilies are spicy OR a bakery) → (dried Thai chilies are a hotpot OR spicy).  \n\nThe consequent “hotpot or spicy” is automatically true if “spicy” is true.  \nSo the only way (5) could be false is if the antecedent is true and the consequent is false.  \nBut the consequent is false only if “not hotpot” and “not spicy” — but if antecedent is true, then “spicy” or “bakery” is true; if “spicy” is true, consequent is true; if “bakery” is true (and not spicy), then consequent is false (since not hotpot and not spicy).  \n\nSo let’s check:  \nAntecedent true, consequent false means:  \n• Dried Thai chilies are bakery (so not spicy by 1) → not spicy, not hotpot (since hotpots are spicy by 3, so can’t be hotpot if not spicy).  \n\n• Then consequent “hotpot or spicy” is false.  \n\nSo statement (5) would be false if dried Thai chilies are a bakery.  \nBut (5) is given as true, so this situation cannot happen.  \nTherefore: dried Thai chilies cannot be a bakery.  \n\nStep 2 – Check if they could be cupcakes  \nCupcakes are bakeries (2).  \nWe just deduced dried Thai chilies cannot be a bakery.  \nSo dried Thai chilies cannot be cupcakes.  \n\nStep 3 – Check if they could be products of Baked by Melissa  \nProducts of Baked by Melissa are cupcakes (4).  \nSo if dried Thai chilies were a product of Baked by Melissa, they’d be cupcakes, which is impossible from Step 2.  \n\nThus the statement “Dried Thai chilies are cupcakes and a product of Baked by Melissa” is false (actually impossible).  \n\nStep 4 – Answer  \nThe statement is false, not uncertain, because we deduced impossibility.  \n\nThe correct option is: B"

Even if koalas are fluffy in real life, the statement “If a koala is very fluffy, then the koala is not a quokka” doesn’t help us conclude they are Max’s favorite animals — because being fluffy is a consequence of being Max’s favorite, not a cause.  \nWe can’t reverse “All Max’s favorite animals are fluffy” to “All fluffy animals are Max’s favorite.”  \n\n6.

About Michael’s blocking ability:  \n   Michael can block anyone who doesn’t jump, except if they are taller than Michael (since taller people can’t be blocked by shorter ones). But Peter is taller than Michael, so Michael couldn’t block Peter even if Peter doesn’t jump.  \n\n3. Windy’s case:  \n   Michael cannot block Windy’s shooting.  \n   Possible reasons:  \n   • Windy is taller than Michael, or  \n\n   • Windy jumps when shooting.  \n\n4. Could Windy be taller than Michael?  \n   Michael is taller than everyone in his class, so if Windy is in his class, Windy cannot be taller than Michael. But we don’t know if Windy is in Michael’s class.  \n   Also, Peter is taller than Michael, so Windy could be Peter or someone even taller, but that’s not stated.  \n\n5. Jumping possibility:  \n   If Windy jumps when shooting, Michael cannot block it (given the rule: Michael can block only if the shooter does not jump).  \n   But jumping also makes Windy a great shooter (from the last statement).  \n\n6. Is Windy necessarily a great shooter?  \n   We know Michael cannot block Windy. That could be due to jumping or due to being taller.  \n   If it’s because Windy jumps, then Windy is a great shooter.  \n   If it’s because Windy is taller, then we don’t know if Windy jumps — so Windy may or may not be a great shooter.  \n\n7.

Interpret \"Michael cannot block Windy’s shooting\":  \n   The rule says Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump.  \n   So if Michael cannot block Windy’s shooting, it means Windy must be jumping when shooting (since that’s the only exception given for Michael’s blocking ability).  \n\n3.

Wait — careful: The statements are about categories of things, not companies owning things. \"All planes are empty\" means every individual plane is empty. \"All airlines can transport multiple passengers\" — but an airline is not a plane; an airline is a company, not a vehicle. So maybe \"airline\" here means an aircraft that is used for airline service? Possibly they’re treating \"airline\" as a type of vehicle? But that’s odd. Let’s check: \"If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not empty.

(This means every animal is a monkey or a bird — but not both? Actually, it says \"either a monkey or a bird\" which in logic often means \"or\" (inclusive or exclusive?), but in natural language \"either A or B\" can be exclusive. However, if it were exclusive, then mammals that are not monkeys would not be animals — but that contradicts \"all mammals are animals.\" So maybe they mean: the set of animals is partitioned into monkeys and birds? That would mean all animals are monkeys or birds, and no animal is both. But birds are not mammals, so animals = monkeys ∪ birds, and monkeys ∩ birds = ∅. But that would mean: no other mammals except monkeys exist. This is important.)\n\n   Let’s check: If all animals are either monkeys or birds, then:\n   • All mammals are animals (given) → so all mammals are either monkeys or birds.  \n\n   • But all monkeys are mammals (given), so monkeys ⊆ mammals ⊆ animals.  \n\n   • Then mammals = monkeys (since if a mammal is not a monkey, it must be a bird — but birds are not mammals, so impossible).  \n\n   • So actually mammals = monkeys.  \n\n   • So every animal is either a monkey (mammal) or a bird (non-mammal).  \n\n   So \"All mammals are animals\" + \"All monkeys are mammals\" + \"An animal is either a monkey or a bird\" → The only mammals are monkeys; there are no non-monkey mammals.  \n\n2.

But here \"neither a fly nor a bird\" uses \"fly\" as noun (insect). So \"fly\" = insect in that phrase.  \n\n   So: If Rock is not an insect and not a bird → then Rock neither flies (verb) nor breathes.  \n\n4. We are told: Based on the above information, is \"Rock is a monkey\" true, false, or uncertain?  \n\n   We don’t know if Rock is an animal. But let’s see what we can deduce:  \n\n   • Suppose Rock is an animal. Then Rock is either a monkey or a bird (from fact 1).  \n\n   • If Rock is a bird, then Rock flies (all birds fly).  \n\n   • But the conditional says: If Rock is neither a fly (insect) nor a bird, then (Rock does not fly and Rock does not breathe).  \n\n   • If Rock is a monkey → then Rock is a bird? No, monkey and bird are disjoint (from either-or partitioning of animals). So Rock is not a bird.  \n\n   • Also Rock is not a fly (insect) presumably (since monkeys aren’t insects).  \n\n   • So if Rock is a monkey, then Rock is neither a fly nor a bird → then the conditional applies: Rock neither flies nor breathes.  \n\n   But wait — all animals breathe. Monkeys are animals → monkeys breathe.  \n   So if Rock is a monkey, then Rock breathes. But the conditional says if Rock is neither fly nor bird, then Rock does not breathe.  \n\n   Contradiction: Being a monkey → not bird & not fly → then not breathe (by conditional) but being monkey → animal → breathe.  \n\n   So the only way to avoid contradiction: Rock cannot be a monkey.  \n\n   Because if Rock were a monkey, then:  \n   • Rock is not a fly (noun) [true]  \n\n   • Rock is not a bird [true]  \n\n   • Then by the conditional: Rock neither flies (ok, monkeys don’t fly) nor breathes (contradiction: monkeys breathe).  \n\n   So the given statements imply Rock is not a monkey.  \n\nTherefore: \"Rock is a monkey\" is false.  \n\nThe correct option is: B"

All birds fly.  \n5. All animals breathe.  \n6. If something can fly, then it has wings.  \n7. If Rock is neither a fly nor a bird, then Rock neither flies nor breathes.  \n\nStep 1 – Interpret statement 3.  \n\"An animal is either a monkey or a bird\" means:  \nAnimal → (Monkey ∨ Bird).  \nFrom 1 and 2: Monkey → Mammal → Animal.  \nSo monkeys are animals, birds are animals (implied by 3? Actually 3 says animal → monkey or bird, so all animals are monkeys or birds, so birds must be animals).  \n\nThus: Animal = Monkey ∪ Bird.  \nAnd Monkey ∩ Bird = ∅ (since monkey is a mammal, bird is not a mammal).  \n\nStep 2 – Interpret statement 7.  \n\"Rock is neither a fly nor a bird\" → Rock neither flies nor breathes.  \nWait: \"neither a fly nor a bird\" — \"fly\" here probably means \"a fly\" (insect), not \"to fly\"? Possibly a typo? But in logic puzzles, sometimes \"fly\" as noun (the insect) appears. But here, \"All birds fly\" uses \"fly\" as verb.

Then statement true.  \n\n• If Rock were a monkey (hence mammal, hence animal), then from 3, animal is monkey or bird, so if Rock is animal and not bird, then Rock is monkey. Monkeys are not birds, so from 4, only birds fly, so Rock does not fly. From 6, flying things have wings, but Rock doesn’t fly, so we can’t deduce Rock has wings. So maybe false.  \n\n• If Rock is not an animal at all, then not a bird, so doesn’t fly (except if Rock is a fly (insect) which might fly — but \"fly\" insect not necessarily in \"all birds fly\" category, but puzzle says: \"If something can fly, then it has wings\" — if Rock is a fly insect, then it flies, so has wings — but we don’t know if Rock is a fly).  \n\nWe don’t know if Rock is a fly or a bird or something else.  \n\nStep 5 – Check if we can deduce Rock’s animal status.  \nGiven 3, all animals are monkeys or birds.  \nIf Rock were an animal, then:  \n• If Rock is a bird → flies → has wings → statement true.  \n\n• If Rock is a monkey → doesn’t fly → no necessity for wings → statement false.  \n\nSo if Rock is an animal, we can’t say for sure if it has wings without knowing if it’s a bird or monkey.  \n\nBut we don’t know if Rock is an animal.  \nIf Rock is not an animal, maybe Rock is a fly (insect) — then it flies (assume insects fly) → has wings → true.  \nIf Rock is not animal and not a fly (insect) — e.g., Rock is a rock — then doesn’t fly → no necessity for wings → false.  \n\nSo without knowing what Rock is, it’s uncertain if Rock has wings.  \n\nStep 6 – Conclusion  \nWe cannot determine truth value of \"Rock has wings\" from the given.  \n\nThe correct option is: C  \n\nBut the options given are:  \nA) True  \nB) False  \nC) Uncertain  \n\nSo answer is C.  \n\nThe correct option is: C"

So if Rock does not breathe, Rock is not an animal.  \n\nFrom statement 7: If Rock is not a fly and not a bird → Rock does not breathe → Rock is not an animal.  \n\nStep 4 – Is Rock a bird?  \nIf Rock were a bird, then from (4) all birds fly, and from (6) if it flies, it has wings.  \nSo if Rock is a bird → Rock has wings.  \n\nBut the question says: \"Rock is neither a fly nor a bird\" is a conditional in statement 7, not necessarily given as fact.  \nWe don’t know if Rock is a bird or not from the given facts — we only know the implication.  \n\nStep 5 – Do we know Rock’s animal status?  \nWe’re not told whether Rock is a fly, bird, or something else.  \nWe need to determine if “Rock does not have wings” is true/false/uncertain.  \n\nFrom (6): Has wings ← Can fly. Contrapositive: If no wings → cannot fly.  \n\nWe don’t know if Rock can fly.  \nIf Rock is a bird → flies → has wings → statement “Rock does not have wings” would be false.  \nIf Rock is not a bird:  \n• From (3), if Rock is an animal → Rock is a monkey (since not bird) → mammal → animal → breathes.  \n\n• Monkeys are not birds, so from (4) only birds fly, so monkeys don’t fly → from (6) flying things have wings, but monkeys don’t fly, so we cannot infer they don’t have wings? Wait — having wings is conditional on flying: If flies → has wings.  \n\nNo wings → cannot fly (contrapositive). But if doesn’t fly, we can’t infer no wings (could have wings but not fly — but in this logic, maybe all winged things fly? Not stated. Only one direction given).  \n\nSo we can’t deduce monkeys have no wings — maybe some monkeys have wings (like flying monkeys in fiction) — but in real world no, but here we must stick to given facts.  \n\nGiven facts: Only birds fly (since all birds fly, and animals are monkeys or birds, so only birds among animals fly; non-animals? Flies are insects, not animals? Wait — \"fly\" insect not in animal category? Actually, statement 3 says \"An animal is either a monkey or a bird\" — so no other animals. So any flying thing is either a bird or a fly (insect). If something flies and is not a fly (insect) → must be bird → has wings.  \n\nActually, statement 6: If something can fly, then it has wings. So all flying things have wings.  \nDo flies (insects) have wings? Yes, but not relevant unless Rock is a fly.  \n\nWe are told: If Rock is neither a fly nor a bird → Rock doesn’t fly.  \nSo if Rock is not a fly and not a bird → doesn’t fly.  \nFrom that, we cannot infer Rock has no wings (wings possible without flying in this logic).  \n\nBut could Rock be a fly? If Rock is a fly → flies → has wings (since flies have wings in real world, but is that given? Statement 6 says if it can fly, it has wings. So if Rock is a fly, it flies (assume flies can fly) → has wings. So then “Rock does not have wings” false.  \n\nIf Rock is a bird → has wings → “Rock does not have wings” false.  \n\nIf Rock is not a fly and not a bird → doesn’t fly. But could have wings?  \nWe need to check if anything in this world has wings but doesn’t fly.  \nGiven: Animals = monkeys or birds. Birds fly, monkeys don’t (since only birds fly). Non-animals: flies (insects) fly and have wings. Anything else? Not stated.  \nSo if Rock is not a fly and not a bird → Rock is not an animal? Wait, from statement 7: If Rock is not a fly and not a bird → doesn’t fly and doesn’t breathe. Doesn’t breathe → not an animal. So Rock is not an animal.  \n\nNon-animals: flies (which are excluded here) and maybe other things (trees, rocks).  \nIf Rock is not animal and not fly (insect) → maybe Rock is inanimate. Then doesn’t fly, doesn’t breathe, and no info about wings.  \nCould an inanimate thing have wings? Toy airplane? Not in this biological context.  \nBut since no facts say “if it has wings then it can fly” (only converse), we can’t deduce that non-flying things have no wings.  \n\nSo “Rock does not have wings” is not necessarily true — it’s uncertain because we don’t know if Rock is a bird, a fly, or something else.  \n\nBut wait — we know: If Rock is a bird → has wings. If Rock is a fly → has wings. If Rock is neither → not animal, not fly → maybe a rock (literal) → no wings. So is it certain that Rock has no wings?  \n\nNo — because we don’t know which category Rock is in. Without knowing if Rock is a bird/fly/something else, we can’t say for sure it doesn’t have wings.  \n\nThus: Uncertain.  \n\nStep 6 – Matching to options.  \nUncertain → Option C.  \n\nThe correct option is: C"

Wedding → At least one child.  \n   (All people who have a wedding have at least one child.)  \n\n2. Travel to Paris for honeymoon → Wedding.  \n\n3. Wedding in July → Travel to Paris for honeymoon.  \n\n4. Some weddings in July are well-attended.  \n\n5. If John has at least one child → John does not travel to Paris for honeymoon AND does not have a wedding.  \n   (John has at least one child → no Paris honeymoon AND no wedding.)  \n\n6. If John has a wedding that is well-attended → (John has a wedding in July) OR (if not July, then John travels to Paris for honeymoon).  \n   (Well-attended wedding → (July wedding) ∨ (¬July wedding → Paris honeymoon)).  \n   But \"if not July, then Paris honeymoon\" means: ¬July wedding → Paris honeymoon.  \n   So: Well-attended wedding → (July wedding) ∨ (¬July wedding ∧ Paris honeymoon).  \n   But that’s just: Well-attended wedding → (July wedding) ∨ Paris honeymoon.  \n   Because if not July, then Paris honeymoon. Wait, careful:  \n   Actually: Well-attended wedding → [July wedding] ∨ [¬July wedding → Paris honeymoon].  \n   The second part: ¬July wedding → Paris honeymoon means: If wedding not in July, then Paris honeymoon.  \n   So the whole implication is: Well-attended wedding → (July wedding) ∨ (Paris honeymoon).  \n   Yes: because \"A or (if not A then B)\" simplifies to \"A or B\".  \n\n2. From premise 5:  \nJohn has at least one child → no wedding.  \nBut from premise 1: Wedding → at least one child.  \nSo if John has a wedding, he has at least one child.  \nBut premise 5 says: if John has at least one child, then he has no wedding.  \nSo if John has at least one child, then he has no wedding.  \nBut if he has no wedding, then he can’t have at least one child from the wedding (premise 1 only goes one way: wedding → child, not necessarily child → wedding).  \nSo maybe John has a child from other means (not wedding-related).  \n\nBut premise 5: Child → no wedding AND no Paris honeymoon.  \nSo if John has a child, he has no wedding.  \n\n3. Check consistency of premises:  \nPremise 1: Wedding → Child.  \nPremise 5: Child → no Wedding.  \nSo if someone has a wedding, they have a child (premise 1), but if they have a child, they have no wedding (premise 5).  \nContradiction for anyone with a wedding:  \nSuppose John has a wedding. Then from 1, John has a child. Then from 5, John has no wedding. Contradiction.  \nTherefore, No one can have a wedding given premises 1 and 5 together.  \n\nBut premise 4 says: Some weddings in July are well-attended. That means there exists someone with a July wedding.  \nContradiction: Premises 1 and 5 together make weddings impossible, yet premise 4 says there are July weddings.  \n\n4. Conclusion about consistency:  \nThe set of statements is inconsistent.  \nBut the question asks: Based on the info, is it true, false, or uncertain that John has at least one child?  \n\nFrom the inconsistent premises, you can derive anything, including that John has a child and that John doesn’t have a child.  \nBut in logic, from contradiction, everything is true, but that’s not useful here.  \nWe must see what’s forced by premises about John specifically.  \n\n5. Focus on John:  \nPremise 5: If John has at least one child → no wedding and no Paris.  \nPremise 1: If John has a wedding → at least one child.  \nSo for John: Having a wedding leads to child (1), which leads to no wedding (5) — impossible. So John cannot have a wedding.  \n\nSo John has no wedding.  \n\nDoes John have a child? Unknown:  \n• If he has a child, premise 5 is satisfied (no wedding, no Paris) — possible.  \n\n• If he has no child, also possible (premise 5 is vacuously true if no child).  \n\nNothing forces John to have a child or to not have a child.  \n\nBut wait — premise 4 talks about some weddings in July (other people), not John.  \nPremise 6 is about if John has a well-attended wedding, but we know John has no wedding, so premise 6 is vacuously true for John.  \n\nSo no info about John’s child status except premise 5’s conditional.  \nWe don’t know the antecedent (whether John has a child).  \n\n6.

So the statement “Neither yellow nor ugly” is equivalent to “Not Yellow” (since Not Ugly is true).  \n\nSo the whole statement becomes:  \nFalse ∨ (Not Yellow) = Not Yellow.  \n\nBut do we know if Ben is Not Yellow?  \nWe know Ben is either From The Simpsons or Funny.  \n• If Ben is From The Simpsons, he could be Yellow or not Yellow (we don’t know — Yellow → From The Simpsons, but not necessarily the reverse).  \n\n• If Ben is Funny but not From The Simpsons, then definitely not Yellow (because Yellow → From The Simpsons).  \n\nSo Ben’s yellowness is uncertain.  \n\nThus “Not Yellow” is uncertain.  \nTherefore the whole statement “(Yellow and Ugly) or (Neither yellow nor ugly)” is uncertain because it hinges on whether Ben is Yellow or not.  \n\nWait — let’s check carefully.  \n\nLet P = Yellow, Q = Ugly.  \n\nStatement: (P ∧ Q) ∨ (¬P ∧ ¬Q)  \nThis is P ↔ ¬Q (since (P∧Q)∨(¬P∧¬Q) is XNOR, i.e., P and Q have same truth value? Let’s check truth table:  \n\nP=T, Q=T: (T)∨(F)=T  \nP=T, Q=F: (F)∨(F)=F  \nP=F, Q=T: (F)∨(F)=F  \nP=F, Q=F: (F)∨(T)=T  \n\nActually, that’s wrong — let’s recompute carefully:  \n\n(P and Q) or (not P and not Q) truth table:  \n\nP Q P∧Q ¬P∧¬Q\n (P∧Q)∨(¬P∧¬Q)  \nT T T F\n T  \nT F F F\n F  \nF T F F\n F  \nF F F T\n T  \n\nSo it’s P ≡ Q (P if and only if Q), not P ↔ ¬Q.  \n\nSo statement says: Ben’s yellowness = Ben’s ugliness.  \n\nWe know Ben’s ugliness = False.  \nSo statement says: Yellow ≡ False, i.e., Yellow = False.  \n\nSo the statement is equivalent to: Ben is not Yellow.  \n\nBut we don’t know if Ben is Yellow or not.  \n\nSo the statement’s truth value is uncertain.  \n\nFinal answer:  \n\nThe correct option is: C"

Analyzing Jerry’s situation:\n\nFrom (3): Every person either studies or teaches.  \nFrom (5): Jerry does not teach.  \nSo Jerry must study.  \n\nFrom (2): Studies → Student.  \nSo Jerry is a student.  \n\nFrom (1): Student → Human.  \nSo Jerry is human.  \n\nThus Human(Jerry) is true for sure.  \n\n4. Question statement becomes:  \n\n¬(Student(Rose) ∧ True)  \n= ¬(Student(Rose))  \n= Rose is not a student.  \n\nSo the question is equivalent to: Is Rose necessarily not a student?  \n\n5. Analyzing Rose’s situation:\n\nFrom (6): Rose is young or a student.  \n\nCase 1: Rose is young.  \nFrom (4): Young → ¬Teaches.  \nFrom (3): Person(Rose) → Studies ∨ Teaches.  \nIf Rose is a person, then since she doesn’t teach, she must study.  \nStudies → Student.  \nSo if Rose is a person and young, she studies → she is a student.  \n\nSo if Rose is a person, then Young(Rose) → Student(Rose).  \n\nCase 2: Rose is a student (given in the “or” in (6)).  \n\nSo in both cases, if Rose is a person, she is a student.  \n\n6. Do we know Rose is a person?\n\nThe context talks about “students”, “humans”, “a person” in (3).  \n(3) says “A person either studies or teaches” — but does it say Rose is a person?  \nThe statements about Rose and Jerry seem to treat them as “someone” in the sense of persons.  \nTypically in these logic puzzles, named entities like Rose and Jerry are persons unless stated otherwise.  \nIf Rose is not a person, then (3) and (4) don’t apply to her, and (6) could be satisfied by her being young (but not a student) if she’s e.g., a young cat. But “young” in (4) is about “young person” implicitly (since it says “no young person teaches”). So “young” likely means “young person”.  \n\nThus if Rose is young, she is a young person → person.  \nIf Rose is a student, from (1) she is human → person.  \n\nSo (6) implies Rose is a person.  \n\nTherefore Rose is a person.  \n\n7. Conclusion about Rose:\n\nFrom earlier: Rose is a person and (young or student).  \nIf young: from (4) she doesn’t teach → from (3) she studies → from (2) she is a student.  \nIf student: obviously student.  \n\nSo Rose is necessarily a student.  \n\n8. Back to the question statement:\n\nWe need ¬(Student(Rose) ∧ Human(Jerry)).  \nWe have Student(Rose) = True, Human(Jerry) = True.  \nSo (True ∧ True) = True.  \nNegation = False.  \n\nSo the statement “It is not true that Rose is a student and Jerry is a human” is false.  \n\nBecause in fact Rose is a student and Jerry is human.  \n\nFinal answer:  \nThe correct option is: B"

Check if Jack takes the database course:  \n   • To take the database course → must be from CS department (given).  \n\n   • Being instructed by Prof. David → taking database course (given).  \n\n   • Working in the lab → instructed by Prof. David (given).  \n\n   • But Jack does not work in the lab, so we cannot conclude he is instructed by Prof. David.  \n\n3. Could Jack take the database course without working in the lab?  \n   • The statements say:  \n\n     ◦ All lab workers are instructed by Prof. David.  \n\n     ◦ All instructed by Prof. David take database course.  \n\n     ◦ But it does not say that only lab workers take the database course.  \n\n   • So it’s possible for someone to take the database course without working in the lab if they are somehow instructed by Prof. David without working in the lab — but the text says all students instructed by Prof. David are taking database course, not the reverse (i.e., it doesn’t say all database students are instructed by Prof. David). Wait — actually check:  \n\n     ◦ \"All students instructed by Prof. David are taking the database course\" — yes.  \n\n     ◦ \"All students working in the lab are instructed by Prof. David\" — yes.  \n\n     ◦ Reverse: To be taking database course, must you be instructed by Prof. David?

But Jack does not have a university part-time job (which would require working in library), but he could still work in the library without a university job? No — \"All students who have part-time jobs offered by the university are students who work in the library\" doesn’t mean only job holders work in library; so Jack might work in the library without a university job?

Check for contradictions in premises.\n\nFrom (2) and (3) and (4):  \nGood relationship with parents → Fulfill intakes → Grew up in health-conscious home → Eat salads regularly.  \n\nBut (5) says: Good relationship with parents → Do not eat salads regularly.  \n\nSo if someone has a good relationship with parents, they must both eat salads regularly (from 4+3+2) and not eat salads regularly (from 5). This is a contradiction unless no one can have a good relationship with their parents under these rules.  \n\n3. Resolve the contradiction for the general case.\n\nIf someone has a good relationship with parents:  \n• From (4) and (3) and (2): they eat salads regularly.  \n\n• From (5): they do not eat salads regularly.  \n\nContradiction.  \n\nTherefore, it is impossible for anyone to have a good relationship with their parents given these premises.  \n\nSo in reality, \"Good relationship with parents\" must be false for everyone.  \n\n4. Apply to Taylor’s either-or statement (premise 7).\n\nPremise 7 says:  \nEither (Health-conscious home AND Good relationship) OR (Neither Health-conscious home NOR Good relationship).  \n\nFirst part: (Health-conscious home AND Good relationship) — impossible because Good relationship is impossible.  \n\nSo only the second part is possible:  \nNeither grew up in health-conscious home NOR Good relationship with parents.  \n\nThus:  \n• Taylor did not grow up in health-conscious home.  \n\n• Taylor does not have good relationship with parents.  \n\n5. Question statement:  \n\"Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor does she visit the gym at least once a day.\"  \n\nWe already know: Taylor did not grow up in health-conscious home (True).  \n\nWe need to check the second part: \"nor does she visit the gym at least once a day.\"  \n\nFrom (6): Visit gym daily → Fulfill nutritional intakes → Grew up in health-conscious home (from 3).  \n\nBut Taylor did not grow up in health-conscious home.  \n\nSo she cannot have visited gym daily (otherwise she’d have grown up in health-conscious home, contradiction).  \n\nTherefore:  \n• Not health-conscious home: True  \n\n• Not visit gym daily: True  \n\nSo the whole statement is True.  \n\n6. Conclusion:  \nThe statement is True.  \n\nThe correct option is: A"

If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs → KiKi is terricolous or has legs.  \n\n2. Understanding the logical connections:\n\nFrom (5): Terricolous → has legs → jumps (from 4).  \n\nSo: Terricolous → has legs → jumps → Jane likes it (from 3).  \n\nAlso, jumps → Jane likes it, but jumps and barks cannot both be true for the same animal (because barks → Jane does not like it).  \n\nBut that conflict doesn’t matter unless we know KiKi barks.  \n\n3. Focus on KiKi’s attributes from statement (6):\n\n(6) says: If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs → (KiKi is terricolous or has legs).  \n\nBut “neither jumps nor has legs” means: ¬jumps ∧ ¬has legs.  \n\nIf that’s true, then the consequent says: terricolous ∨ has legs.  \n\nBut if ¬has legs is true, then “has legs” is false, so “terricolous or has legs” simplifies to “terricolous”.  \n\nSo (6) says: If ¬jumps ∧ ¬has legs → terricolous.  \n\n4. Check if ¬jumps ∧ ¬has legs is possible given other rules:\n\nFrom (4): has legs → jumps. Contrapositive: ¬jumps → ¬has legs.  \n\nSo if ¬jumps is true, then ¬has legs is automatically true.  \n\nThus, ¬jumps ∧ ¬has legs is equivalent to just ¬jumps.  \n\nSo (6) simplifies to: If ¬jumps → terricolous.  \n\nBecause: ¬jumps → ¬has legs (from contrapositive of 4), so the antecedent of (6) is satisfied whenever ¬jumps is true.  \n\nSo (6) effectively says: ¬jumps → terricolous.  \n\n5. But from (5): terricolous → has legs → jumps.  \n\nSo terricolous → jumps. Contrapositive: ¬jumps → ¬terricolous.  \n\n6. Contradiction between (6) and (5):\n\nFrom (6): ¬jumps → terricolous.  \nFrom (5): ¬jumps → ¬terricolous.  \n\nThe only way both can be true is if ¬jumps is never true.  \n\nThat is: KiKi must jump.  \n\nBecause if ¬jumps were true, we’d have: terricolous (from 6) and ¬terricolous (from 5) — impossible.  \n\nSo ¬jumps is false.  \n\nThus: KiKi jumps.  \n\n7. Does KiKi jump mean KiKi is terricolous?\n\nNot necessarily. Jump → has legs (from 4? Wait, 4 says: has legs → jumps, not the reverse. So jump does not imply has legs — maybe jumps without legs? But rule 4 doesn’t say all jumping animals have legs, so possible. But we don’t know.)  \n\nWe know jumps is true, so antecedent of (6) is false, so (6) gives no info.  \n\nFrom jumps true, we can’t deduce terricolous because terricolous → jumps, but not vice versa.  \n\nWe have no other premise forcing terricolous.  \n\n8.

But  \\neg J \\land \\neg L  says  L  is false.  \nThus \\( (\\neg J \\land \\neg L) \\) and  T  cannot both be true (because  T  would force  L  true, contradicting  \\neg L ).  \n\nSo the implication \\( (\\neg J \\land \\neg L) \\rightarrow T \\) can only be true if the antecedent \\( (\\neg J \\land \\neg L) \\) is false (otherwise we’d have a contradiction:  T  true and  L  false, impossible given  T \\rightarrow L ).\n\nTherefore: \\( \\neg (\\neg J \\land \\neg L) \\) must be true.  \nThat is:  J \\lor L  is true for KiKi.\n\n3. What does  J \\lor L  imply?\n\nFrom statement 4:  L \\rightarrow J .  \nSo  J \\lor L  simplifies:  \n• If  L  true →  J  true →  J  true.  \n\n• If  L  false →  J  must be true (because  J \\lor L  true and  L  false ⇒  J  true).  \n\nSo in both cases:  J  is true.  \n\nThus KiKi jumps.\n\n4. From  J  true:\n\nStatement 3: \\( J \\rightarrow \\text{Likes}(Jane, KiKi) \\) ⇒ Jane likes KiKi.\n\nStatement 1: \\( \\text{Barks}(KiKi) \\rightarrow \\neg \\text{Likes}(Jane, KiKi) \\).  \nBut Jane likes KiKi, so \\( \\text{Barks}(KiKi) \\) must be false.\n\n5. Conclusion about “KiKi barks and is a dog”:\n\nWe have \\( \\text{Barks}(KiKi) \\) is false.  \nSo “KiKi barks and is a dog” is false (first conjunct false ⇒ whole conjunction false).\n\n6. Check if uncertain due to possibility KiKi not an animal:\n\nThe statements are mostly about “if an animal …” but statement 6 is directly about KiKi.  \nStatement 6’s implication would be vacuously true if KiKi were not an animal? No — statement 6 doesn’t say “If KiKi is an animal and …”, it just says “If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs…”.  \nSo KiKi could be a non-animal? But then the other rules about animals wouldn’t apply to KiKi, so we couldn’t deduce anything from them.  \n\nBut statement 2 says “All dogs are animals that bark” — if KiKi is a dog, then KiKi is an animal.  \nSo if KiKi is a dog, then KiKi is an animal, and all the animal rules apply.  \n\nWe want to know truth value of “KiKi barks and is a dog.”  \nWe know “KiKi barks” is false (from steps 3–4, which assumed KiKi is an animal — but is that assumption justified?).\n\nWe must check: Do we know KiKi is an animal?  \nThe given info doesn’t explicitly say KiKi is an animal.  \nIf KiKi is not an animal, then statements 1,3,4,5 don’t apply to KiKi, so we can’t deduce that KiKi doesn’t bark.  \nAlso statement 6 is weird if KiKi is not an animal — it’s still a logical statement about KiKi, but “terricolous” typically means land-dwelling (animals). Possibly they intend KiKi to be an animal, but it’s not explicitly stated.\n\nBut statement 6’s deduction that  J  is true did not use KiKi being an animal — it’s purely logical from statement 6 and 5.  \nLet’s check:  \nFrom statement 5:  T \\rightarrow L  for any  x  (it says “If an animal is terricolous…” — so that’s restricted to animals).  \nSo if KiKi is not an animal, statement 5 doesn’t apply, so  T \\rightarrow L  might not hold for KiKi, so our deduction that  J  is true fails.\n\nThus: If KiKi is not an animal, we can’t deduce anything from 1–5, only from 6 and 5 not applicable, so statement 6’s implication might be satisfiable without  J  being true.  \nSo “KiKi barks” could be true or false if KiKi is not an animal.  \n\nBut the statement in question is “KiKi barks and is a dog.”  \nIf KiKi is not an animal, then “KiKi is a dog” is false (since dogs are animals). So the conjunction is false.  \nIf KiKi is an animal, then as above, “KiKi barks” is false, so conjunction false.  \n\nSo in either case (animal or not), the statement is false.\n\n7. Final answer:\n\nThe statement is false regardless of whether KiKi is an animal.\n\nThe correct option is: B"

But being terricolous implies having legs (statement 5).  \n\n3.
