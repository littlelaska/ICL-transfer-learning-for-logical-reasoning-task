    "question": "Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?",
    "cot": "Natalia sold 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 clips in May.\nNatalia sold 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 clips altogether in April and May.",
    "answer": "72",
    "reasoning_cot": "1. In April, Natalia sold clips to 48 friends.  \n   So, clips sold in April =  48 .\n\n2. In May, she sold half as many clips as in April.  \n   Half of 48 is  48 \\div 2 = 24 .  \n   So, clips sold in May =  24 .\n\n3. Altogether in April and May:  \n    48 + 24 = 72 .\n\nThe final answer is: 72"

    "question": "Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?",
    "cot": "Weng earns 12/60 = $<<12/60=0.2>>0.2 per minute.\nWorking 50 minutes, she earned 0.2 x 50 = $<<0.2*50=10>>10.",
    "answer": "10",
    "reasoning_cot": "We know Weng earns $12 per hour.  \nFirst, convert 50 minutes into hours:  \n\\[\n50 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{50}{60} \\text{ hours} = \\frac{5}{6} \\text{ hours}.\n\\]  \n\nEarnings = hourly rate × hours worked:  \n\\[\n\\text{Earnings} = 12 \\times \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{60}{6} = 10.\n\\]  \n\nThe final answer is: $10."
