    "reasoning_cot": "Let’s break this down step by step.  \n\nStep 1: Understand the costs and selling price  \n• Movie creation cost (fixed cost) = $2000 (this is a one-time cost for producing the movie itself, not per DVD).  \n\n• Cost to make each DVD = $6.  \n\n• Selling price per DVD =  2.5 \\times 6 = 15  dollars.  \n\nStep 2: Profit per DVD  \nProfit per DVD = Selling price − Cost to make  \n\\[\n15 - 6 = 9 \\ \\text{dollars per DVD}.\n\\]  \n\nStep 3: DVDs sold per week  \nHe sells 500 movies (DVDs) a day, 5 days a week.  \n\\[\n500 \\times 5 = 2500 \\ \\text{DVDs per week}.\n\\]  \n\nStep 4: Weekly profit from DVD sales (ignoring fixed cost for now)  \n\\[\n2500 \\times 9 = 22500 \\ \\text{dollars per week}.\n\\]  \n\nStep 5: Total over 20 weeks  \n\\[\n22500 \\times 20 = 450000 \\ \\text{dollars from DVD sales profit}.\n\\]  \n\nStep 6: Subtract the fixed cost  \nThe fixed cost of making the movie ($2000) is a one-time expense before selling.  \n\\[\n450000 - 2000 = 448000.\n\\]  \n\nStep 7: Final profit  \n\\[\n\\boxed{448000}\n\\]  \n\nThe final answer is: 448000"
